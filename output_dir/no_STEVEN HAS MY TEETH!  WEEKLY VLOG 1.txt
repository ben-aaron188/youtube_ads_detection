9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,480
experience and mental areas because my

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,730
dentist is lovely so next week I go back

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cream I presume that goes</font>

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,440
in and then I get lucky white teeth now

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,579
I'm not saying my teeth aren't white but

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,559
it should I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm like</font>

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,420
filming and taking photos but I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,649
of see that they used to be a lot whiter

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,860
and since I found coffee and let all

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,020
other things yeah my teeth and my smile

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,340
just aren't as white as I'd like so it's

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,539
like give it a go and then I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,469
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> share with you guys because it</font>

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,059
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want and I also</font>

24
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,320
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he goes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be scare the</font>

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,370
dome tisk so if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lovely</font>

26
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,110
dentist like mine it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a</font>

27
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,239
pleasurable experience you can smell

28
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,350
something yummy on my fingers deep in

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,650
the gorgeous boy people putting chewing

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,479
gum on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor means that dogs like</font>

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Steven who had to roll around the floor</font>

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,030
get caught in effort I've been trying to

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this off for a couple of days as you</font>

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,080
can see it's attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to his wrinkly</font>

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,640
skin and its really uncomfortable of him

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,020
and it hurts when I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it off</font>

37
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,729
as you can see he's trying to bite me so

38
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,680
guys think before you check your chewing

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,630
gum please just look time in the rain

40
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,400
and Leon's benefit from Key Stages head

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,950
like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard day and night clients</font>

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,299
and I was just a bit stressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously your book coming out and stuff</font>

44
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,720
so I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just treated him to a tree I</font>

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,829
don't know if you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> got one</font>

46
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,570
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the Harriet it's just opened</font>

47
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,340

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,890
yummiest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat so picked him up two</font>

49
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,420
things and they gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,130
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are legends but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

51
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,210
they said it was they didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat</font>

52
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,500
everything so I've literally picked up

53
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,180
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day so technically I</font>

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,340
saved their waistline 10

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,910
hello that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all really thing and a</font>

56
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,210
roller thing and a something for the

57
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,250
buttery goodness thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font>

58
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,140
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fin click now the skin connect</font>

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,060
estoy visited at the beginning of last

60
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,790
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help me with my skin and then</font>

61
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,619
once I was in there a kind of intrigued

62
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,449
by laser hair removal now being a

63
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,430
personal trainer that means I put my

64
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,650
arms up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be honest I was</font>

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,209
getting really nervous and I've been

66
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,580
insecure with a kind of dark sort of

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,230
Homer Simpson shadows I had on my own

68
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,150
pits now hair is beautiful it's just not

69
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I love and so for that</font>

70
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,930
reason I decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try laser hair now</font>

71
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,360
I've been having it done pretty much the

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,100
last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> months of last year's was</font>

73
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,320
every six weeks I think I had six

74
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,150
sessions in total<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I stopped</font>

75
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,160
because I didn't get any more hair now

76
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,959
the reason why I loved it so much is

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,970
because you it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenance-free</font>

78
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">so basically continue as you would</font>

79
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,360
nominate so if you shave you just keep

80
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,850
shaving and then every 6 weeks you go in

81
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,250
and they laser you it takes about my

82
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,470
first ones maybe like 30 seconds per

83
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,760
armpit and then over time it's the

84
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickest thing ever smells a bit weird</font>

85
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,489
smells like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or firm hair um it's not</font>

86
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,769
paying free it's a bit like like a sort

87
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,959
of hot flick so it's uncomfortable for

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,030
the first one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still bearable like</font>

89
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm uses with paint stuff but it's just

90
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,600
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird feeling but it's over so</font>

91
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,450
quickly like it's 15 seconds you can

92
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,430
kind of grin and bear it but today I'm

93
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,790
heading back because it's been 23<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

94
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,410
since I last went in and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted</font>

95
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to check up if there's any little</font>

96
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,500
additional hairs they're going to zap

97
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,720
them away and i think there's four but

98
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to let you guys look at my</font>

99
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,019
armpit this is my right armpit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

100
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,959
not shaved in the last five<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and</font>

101
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,329
this is my left armpit that has been

102
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,670
shaped the same I don't weirdly just

103
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,620
shave one on<font color="#CCCCCC"> pit not the other and it</font>

104
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,840
feels so soft like you know those

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,700
adverts where people the boyfriend

106
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,950
kisses the girlfriends armpit I think

107
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,200
it's late Nivea or sure or something and

108
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,790
I'm like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god I've never let anyone</font>

109
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,200
do that because my armpits would

110
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,390
basically like their face on fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz it</font>

111
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,430

112

269
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,110
keep my teeth in out of the molds

270
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,220
they've made these little plastic

271
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,829
pretend ones basically I slot this in my

272
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,120

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,110
really difficult or most be<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

277
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,310
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> teeth are only getting the front</font>

278
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,329
they're not getting the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

279
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,990
they can't mold it so

280
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,180
front and back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to wear</font>
