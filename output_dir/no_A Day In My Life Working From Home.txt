all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been testing out</font>

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,899
this is sort of my testing ritual so for

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of giving this a really good try</font>

25

<font color="#CCCCCC">and love it burberry and new foundation</font>

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,639
and then I ship this all down to my

27
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,319
office and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of take everything out</font>

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,139
and then swap stuff for new bits and

29
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,209
pieces and I mean I've got my favorites

30
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,520
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how I get stuff properly</font>

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,369
properly properly tested you know on an

32
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,709
everyday basis wearing it out to town

33
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,170
wearing it all day long<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing how it</font>

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,450
cleanses off that sort of thing so yeah

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:16,299
journey commute to the office that's the

39
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,260

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,120
about an hour to tidy this up every week

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,040
now I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people might be</font>

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,200

in the house and so what happens is that

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,329

AMR to construct me some kind of thing

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can take up and down to let the</font>

147
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,300
light because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice and light</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just not good for shooting but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

150
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,550

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,530
horizontal blinds for<font color="#E5E5E5"> reef lights</font>

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,130
because to be quite honest if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font>

153
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,260
for yourself awesome d in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house to</font>

154
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,360
do a job just never gets done does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

155
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,690
you sort of just need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look someone in</font>

156
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,460
and getting to come I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always find</font>

157
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,619
anyway on with day and as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

158
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">I find that I have to sort of prioritize</font>

159
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,619
and just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things done that need</font>

160
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:25,989
to get done which in today's case is all

161
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,239
the posts for a model recommends until

162
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:31,329
next Monday and two posts for the uphill

163
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,789
I've just uploaded loads of videos and

164
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,198
done those videos so don't need a video

165
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a saving grace today because</font>

166
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,318
that takes ages and ages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ages and</font>

167
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,339
also I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to write synopsis for</font>

168
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,410
something that is my main job today but

169
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,480
I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't get my headspace</font>

170
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,370
clear enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until I've done</font>

171
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,170
all of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and then there'll</font>

172
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,959
be so much admin that comes in so I sort

173
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,889
of have to switch off my emails switch I

174
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't get any reception in here anyway</font>

175
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,870
so I don't get mobile phone calls but um

176
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,949
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the email so i can really</font>

177
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,490
concentrate and getting stuff done I've

178
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,899
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> really distracted reading about</font>

179
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brangelina and the breakup and these are</font>

180
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,699

00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,550
coffee tables for in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love the</font>

182
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,199
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things just pop up on your</font>

183
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,019
screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind you so you can't get</font>

184
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,930
away once you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at stuff</font>

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,660
online isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's um two hours</font>

186
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,110
that's gone past<font color="#E5E5E5"> affability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no 33 hours</font>

187
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I literally haven't looked up which</font>

188
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,420
is why my eyes start to look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

189
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,149
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glasses on this isn't gonna</font>

190
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,620
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interest in this video is it</font>

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,709
because on a work day a work work day

192
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,000
all I do is sit here head down plow on

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,329
through hobnob snack bar which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

194
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,680
healthy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see me through the</font>

195
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,589
afternoon and had an apple so you know

196
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of balancing things out I've</font>

197
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:05,680
got 20 new whatsapp messages so that

198
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,750
will distract me for a while I've got so

199
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,120
much to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so much</font>

200
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,570
I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave for book club in three</font>

201
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,860
and a half hours and it's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

202
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,600
borderline ridiculous how much I've got

203
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,370
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually so I'm going to crack on</font>

204
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,400
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talking to the camera and</font>

205
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">then our film things if appropriate</font>

206
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,250
really I need to do another<font color="#E5E5E5"> video with</font>

207
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like work but when I'm away or when</font>

208
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,390
I'm going into town because then I can

209
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,150
do sort of shots of my feet walking

210
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,720
along Oxford Street and you know

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,190
cutaways of people and interesting

212
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,000
things this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally just me haven't</font>

213

214
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,190
of half heartedly tidying and it doesn't

215
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">look any better that's all recycling</font>

216
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,440
that bins got to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and a lot of my</font>

217

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,930
I've written about them already use them

224
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,200
loads and loads and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm swapping that</font>

225
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,839
for the essay edit bronzer which is like

226
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,089
a barely born so it's really nice so

227
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,670
that goes all there and then I've got

228
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,890
highlighter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luminizer undetectable</font>

229
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Luminizer I'm really interested in this</font>

230
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,240
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> make up forever with a brush so</font>

231
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,910
that's going in this very weird-looking

232
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,029
mascara from Mac ghulam concealer I've

233
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,820
got loads of Real Techniques sponge as I

234
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,640
want to try vation from bare minerals

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
which is a powder foundation not

236
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,380
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> really my cup of tea but I'm</font>

237
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,730
gonna give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a go i'm not sure which</font>

me then I've got soap & Glory neutrals

240
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,310
pellets and I've got the YSL contouring

241
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,060
palette which I think comes with this

242
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,870
brush here so pop that in and then the

243
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Smashbox can</font>

244
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
right ready BB so you know I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

245
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,810
get through all of this I like to try

246
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,720
stuff loads and really get used to it

247
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,579
but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

248
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,970
it's all there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just no dig on</font>

249
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,730
in what I need to this is a shelf of

250
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,209
dreams well not of dreams of nightmares

251
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,370
for me this is all sort of stuff that

252
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,620
I've don't pop a nut perfume at the

253
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,180
front i'm testing have tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm trying</font>

254
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,699
to test and it's all sort of categorized

255
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,870
a lot of a bit skincare things like a

256
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,380
feature I want to do on sensitive skin

257
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,029
feature one sort of peel pads and things

258
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,300
like that on really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rich moisturizers I</font>

259
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,910
don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this section is and this</font>

260
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just a load of mess that I haven't</font>

261
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">got round to sorting yet today and now</font>

262
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,709
this is my sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of neat shell flick see</font>

263
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,149
that that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have in the</font>

264
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,529
background of my videos but doesn't

265
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">really show up so it's bit pointless and</font>

266
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,630
then down there we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some sultry</font>

267
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,670
autumn sense and some sort of multi

268
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,930
masking bespoke face masks and it's all

269
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,089
themed so as I think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff because</font>

270
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are so many products in the world</font>

271
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and as I think of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of</font>

272
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,470
categorize it and stick it into little

273
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,430
areas I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is chaotic but it's sort</font>

274
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,440
of organized chaos I've really done

275
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,269
badly at my tidying today but I've sort

276
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of had a lot of admin problems I've got</font>

277
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
distracted so that's pretty much my<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

278
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">day I've got a lot done um I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

279
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,350
but um days with baby are a lot more

280
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy that you know what it's really</font>

281
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,120
difficult because I love having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

282
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,480
to do my<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but a whole day I'm like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

283
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
really want to see the baby and then if

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,860
I have a whole day with the baby I

285
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,899
really want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a cup of hours</font>

286
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,569
to do some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I suppose the ideal</font>

287
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,360
sort of solution to that would be half

288
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,069
days or you know doing two hours here or

289
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,410
three hours here but unfortunately life

290
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,529
doesn't work like that so I'm yeah

291
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,630
tuesdays and wednesdays

292
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,800
my foot on work days and I'm just so

293
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,690
tired by the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that I'm always a</font>

294
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,720
bit like oh my god got brain fry but you

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,950
know that's mark so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I do yeah</font>

296
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,140
so I hope that you enjoyed that and make

297
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,370
sure you go and check out the day with

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,130
