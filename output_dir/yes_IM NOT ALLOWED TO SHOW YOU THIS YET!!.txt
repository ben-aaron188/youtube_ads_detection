the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shower is I'm squeezed you</font>

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,079

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,020
to feel it is all of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> third book</font>

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,620
finished like completely finish so as

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing this third</font>

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,200
book for blooming ages now and I don't

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">even know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told you much about it</font>

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,550
I should probably do that sometime soon

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,379
because it's coming out in like march<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,670
think it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the end like the</font>

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,390
24th of March that's what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've written all of this book and</font>

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">right let me put you down let me be</font>

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,579
honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you let me tell you some</font>

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,470
stuff right here we go right the way in

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">which my third book has happened we're</font>

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,159
going straight into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in today's vlog</font>

24
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,659
but a minute I've need to show you my

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,820
breakfast to my lunch yet so the title

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,150
of my third book is called the scrapbook

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,729
of my life I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this because I</font>

28
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,770
basically wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I don't want to</font>

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,360
do like a biography because obviously

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,939
I'm only 22 so I've still got a lot of

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,030
my life to live yet hopefully and but I

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,770
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give people more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an insight</font>

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,960
because you guys love these daily vlogs

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,299
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to almost create like a daily</font>

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,000
blogs from my whole life going back well

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,369
then going forward so I came up the idea

37
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a scrapbook of my life and it</font>

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,479
literally looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a journal like a</font>

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,920
scrapbook it's not like the pointless

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,540
book it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like that kind of thing</font>

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,880
it's like a scrapbook of my life so I

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,670
literally started I got where is it I

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know where it is I got a notepad</font>

44
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,710
and I asked my publishers how many pages

45
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,469
the book needed to be and I just wrote

46
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,509
on all of the pages pretending it was

47
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,399
going to be like the finished book the

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,810
daily vlog suffered a little bit I

49
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't get to do as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day for</font>

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,590
you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these videos because I was</font>

51
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:10,818
just

52
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,980
at home writing all day or in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> office</font>

53
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,609
writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> day but the book is done I</font>

54
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,739
finished writing the last page last week

55
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,019
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> day as my driving test I finish</font>

56
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,170
living and now it's all just been

57
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,659
printed what I wrote on two pages like

58
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,150
like a book and I've got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,769
and check that I'm happy with everything

60
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:31,969
that I've read them because I haven't

61
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,280
read one page back yet I've wrote the

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,560
entire book and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even read a</font>

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,200
page back should probably do that so

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,349
that's today's task is to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

65
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,510
this the book so far I've got like five

66
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,489
days to go through it make any changes

67
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,620
that i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make and stuff so I've</font>

68
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,299
seen I've seen like most of it already

69
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,129
that as we're going along we've been

70
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:56,510
going through it back on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

71
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,260
and I'm so so happy with it but I miss

75
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,980

78
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,370
to ask them allowed to do this or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> No</font>

79
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,879

177
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,130
away trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this screen capture</font>

178
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,270
basically when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were called gaming</font>

179
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,130
videos obviously have to like record the

180
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,050
screen so that you guys can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's</font>

181
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening in the game I'm the worst with</font>

182
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,900
pc so Morgan's helping me out do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

183
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,250
helping me out do it helping me do it

184
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,040
and it's complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm literally no</font>

185
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,590
idea what's happening with that we've

186
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,910
download you know the games that we want

187
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to play loads of good games the games</font>

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,110
though it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> soo but it generally</font>

189
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">recording the games</font>

190
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,019
[Music]

191
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,710
I still haven't decided whether it is a

192
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,350
good idea or not that I've told you

193
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,230
about the book but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've kind of just</font>

194
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,900
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that I know I should have</font>

195
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,760
caught some management or I should have

196
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the book publishers to at least</font>

197
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,950
ask but if I show you at first without

198
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling them then you're going to know</font>

199
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,250
and there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can do about it</font>

200
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,860
so fingers crossed everything goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

201
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,410
and you guys are allowed to know I'm now

202
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,300
just off walking up to town because

203
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,740

324
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,500
I said yes audible what it is so

325
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
basically ball is like audio books so

326
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,670
instead of reading a book it's like

327
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,590
spoken out loud so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

328
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,210
wash you're falling asleep on the train

329
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,550
and you don't have to be awake enough to

330
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">read the book so sometimes oh and I</font>

331

listened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them whilst we're just</font>

332
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,020

345
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,340
exit out of every life situation I would
