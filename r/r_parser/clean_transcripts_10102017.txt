"no_24 Hours In Provence  Niomi Smart.txt"	"hey everyone welcome back to another vlog I am in Provence in France at the moment this is my first time here and I've just been blown away with how beautiful it is we're literally in the middle of nowhere this is it's basically just lavender field it's just gorgeous and I'm here because looks at time have brought me here and yeah it's so kind of them such a beautiful trip so nice to come somewhere I've never been before I actually wake up at 5:00 a.m. this morning to go on a hotair balloon to see all the lavender fields and it was too windy so I went down to reception them like I'm so sorry but we can't do it and I was like okay fine go back to bed no worries and so I'm back again now and up ready and we're going to go and explore the lavender fields but first of all need some breakfast and I just wanted to show you my room quickly so this is my gorgeous little balcony that I have and then the view is just funny you can actually see some lavender fields down there at the bottom don't worry we're going to see lots more today I hope and then through here we have each bedroom now I did say in here last night why it's probably no in here as tidy as it would normally be and but look at sparse it's amazing like that is basically a jacuzzi right I actually haven't had a chance to go in there which I'm gutted about that no it's gorgeous and all of this there were a lot more of the L'Occitane products but I have already packed them it's like bag to take home I have left out one product oh but I'm going to show you out here so out here we have another little balcony area which is very very gorgeous I think I share it with other people but yeah this is the product that I love Ted the Lumia and they actually gave me another one out here but I'd really packed one with me and this one has many with it so pretty so I'm actually heading back to London tonight so today is going to be a very busy day and got the lavender field some are going to come back use of spa facilities I've got a 90 minute massage that I'm so excited about and then I've got to catch a plane home and because I've got Wimbledon on Friday but that would be lovely that'd be really fun and I'm looking forward to unburden but I do know that I'm here kind of wish that I could stay a bit longer because it's just so so lovely actually while I remember I'm seeing my outfit quickly so my dress is by a band called Templi London and my sandals are by next and my two necklaces here are by soma is breakfast doesn't this just look amazing we've got so many homemade product honey from performed all of these incredible jams apricot raspberries big mmm we've got some homemade almond butter here from from the omentum is to be a really really delicious because I'm definitely going to try some of it I can Nilda so this is what it's going for this is homemade almond milk and I love how thick it is you can just tell how fresh and natural that is some homemade almond butter cherries figs because I'm obsessed with them and then some bread as well oh and a nectarine you're about to get into this Citroen to go to the lavender field how cool is this we are now facing taken by inside view this is just an absolute dream look at this car and there's a really cute little chapel up there stunning now we've got the drone so let's see what kind of footage we can get it sounds like some kind of huge Killer Bee when it first came out I was like what the hell is that so we've now driven out to the countryside even deeper into the countryside to a lady called Joyce this house and private house and it's stunning like a proper French chateau gorgeous know how you can join a serious nice to me so I've come into the kitchen and this is absolutely my dream kitchen I just I can't believe it's so traditional all these gorgeous plates and even this cyborg so so traditional I want to live here and then through here outside we have the courtyard and we are going to have a couple of drinks and fried with olive oil some on earth and then over here is where we're going to be having lunch so picture a look at the band I mean that's an Instagram photo right there no so lunch is life this is a deconstructed ratatouille and I think mostly better we're actually grown here as a man it's amazing and then I go to put aside very shaky and after we leave as possible look at these crepes beaten crap I've never have even cracked and this is an ice cream more like a sorbet made of baby and then remember teachers because I have no idea that tie knots actually come from the inside here or just ripped on but this you find like right deep in here so you can find one there we go there's no none I've also never seen it chickpeas growing before they have a whole field of chickpeas here and inside here you open them out I'll show you if you look at this done something that's a tricky did you go and see what am I just really stupid we're not obviously knew that they grew and field but I've just never seen them like this before mm little pod amazing so we're back at the hotel now and we're going straight in for star treatment I've gone for a Swedish deep tissue massage which feel like I really really need especially my back so I'm so excited so what is amazing what out this is a defining premium I had in my room I knew from last night are you getting this punching and then a serum which is going to the Sun and it was very so good time to say goodbye to the gorgeous hotel I'm so sad that I'm leaving but have been the best 24 hours in Provence so I'm back home now I am so tired like literally struggling to keep my eyes open I think it's obviously because I wake up at 5:00 so yeah that probably explains it doesn't it and today it's just been amazing I can't believe how much I've done 24 hours in Provence who knew how much you could do so so beautiful they're absolutely fed enough of it and I'm just so desperate to go back especially to that chateau that we went to for lunch copy that was for lunch today that seems like days ago and I really want to go to parently it's also a hotel and the lady joy that lives there she holds all these cooking costs and stuff so I think that I'd be so lovely to just go like spend five days there totally relaxing eating amazing food and so yeah I'm going to look into that but I really hope you've enjoyed watching this vlog and maybe you've got no Provence a little bit from my few hours there but yeah thank you for watching guys and I'll see you very soon bye you"	1371

hotel an hour of traveling after 14 hours of flying an hour and a half this train ride over here it's so raining people here in Japan have these things called umbrellas don't have in America crazy technology engines I'm getting wet this view is insane and probably why this hotel cost more than your average hotel here in Tokyo just just to take a look at this check this out though Oh boss dude this view is unreal this is such a blessing you just don't see stuff like this typically in America I mean it's just a look at how it's so it's so dense so densely populated it's beautiful the city is absolutely gorgeous look at it oh my gosh we're so high up weight yoga what is that tower thing Tokyo towers that's where this I should probably give you the light back so you can poop on you guys have seen the view it's obviously gorgeous and I want to apologize for like the sporadic vlogging when you haven't slapped a whole lot in like two days you know preparing for a massive trip like this it's hard to find the time to blog and then the time to nap and then combine that with like hours in the plane and like the Train and like Tokyo is insane whenever you start getting on the trains and you're in the subway it was like we didn't even know where to go at the time and we're just like carrying would you look at these few cases this is just one of them this is big like this is I'm a fairly tall human being man all right that's like as big as my leg and so as you can imagine you know like try to maneuver through a place we've never been before and obviously there's not a lot of English it was difficult and you we had zero time to whip out the cameras and not to mention there's like a hundred thousand people shouldertoshoulder just like trying to get to their trains make things on time people walk three times faster here it's almost like a light jog it was absolutely insane but check this out so the room is actually very small I can't show you the bathroom right now let's go to see Cho go poop this is this is a closet I'll have you in check this what is it all this is for putting your shoes on all I thought it was like a giant spoon for cooking oh we have a safe inside of here so this is chocolate ice bed the boys are sharing a hotel room and then the girls are like two rooms down very small very cozy very studio like a very nice little small TV there's like one mirror it's a very interesting hotel layout but you're not paying for the hotel room not by a long shot you're paying for this gorgeous and insane view while you're staying in Tokyo just so pretty don't panic guys you're simple okay Junko stop panicking don't try I was like man I really hope I can up with my blog content you know what I mean because we're in a different place you're in a hotel

give someone one piece of relationship advice what would it be JJ and be friends will be friends is your whoever you're in a relationship with Wow how insightful we want some sort of like underdogs

thud thud thud where was that from that from Suite Life of Zack & Cody yeah Joey tough I great we're gonna hug him ding ding ding I wasn't being a pest obviously do you see you work on yourself for your relationship by being motivated to become a bigger and better person for yourself you continue to bring something good to your relationship and I think that when you're in a relationship as well as a couple motivating each other you have to be selfmotivated to become the person that you are capable of being and I think that by both having that inner desire you bring something really unique it does make sense a Emilia's on a mission to be about self in her career with her friends and her family is constantly looking to improve and grow she brings something that is continually improving and manifesting in her relationship and that in turn creates what does it create a very dynamic is the same way as your partner was doing the same yeah those are moving forward in a positive way whether

"no_A Day In My Life Working From Home.txt"	"hello everyone if you watched my day in the life blog with baby and you'll know that I promise to do yes its texture on the computer you'll know that I promise to do a day in the life Rach day because I have a nanny two days a week and on those days I just sort of came my work so that's what this is can you stop it so we started to do the same way with baby coming into bed to have her milk and then sometimes I managed to grab a shower which I wouldn't normally do on a baby day this is the problem and I'm given the time I dick around don't even know I'm doing checking things on Twitter and just flicked through Grazia I've got so much to do but it's like I'm giving this free reign and I could do what I like can I just go the opposite of crazy I go into slow mode every week I take my makeup bag from one suite with all the things I've been testing out this is sort of my testing ritual so for example of giving this a really good try and love it burberry and new foundation and then I ship this all down to my office and I sort of take everything out and then swap stuff for new bits and pieces and I mean I've got my favorites but this is how I get stuff properly properly properly tested you know on an everyday basis wearing it out to town wearing it all day long seeing how it cleanses off that sort of thing so yeah this is coming out with me I getting my bag by Dax this is where I begin my long journey commute to the office that's the door screaming because it's so messy in here it's it's just beyond you know it looks a lot worse than it is it takes me about an hour to tidy this up every week now I know that some people might be looking at that mess with horrified expressions I only gets come in here on tuesdays and wednesdays the recipe I can't have the baby in here because it's just like ruins my Zen that's right phrase in an emergency yeah I might bring him in and forgot to do something urgently but the rest of the time I work over snatch pockets of time as you've seen in the other day in my life video and just trying to work whenever I can in the house and so what happens is that this becomes a sort of dumping ground from thursday to monday with me dashing in and out dropping off new stuff that's come in and rummaging around to find desperately things i need so i can get my work done really quickly and so I never come in here and think oh I'll just have a little tidy because I simply do not have the time last week I was in Paris for the Tuesday and Wednesday so I didn't get any office time at all and then yesterday I was launching the new channel for the uphill and that was just admin nightmare and things is going wrong all day and so I didn't have chance to do it then so that just that's why the the mess get that hand it's not because I'm lazy and carpet bother to do it is literally I do not have the time and and then it's all done again on a Tuesday if I'm here and it's all nice and tidy so at the end of the day I'll show you what it looks like when it's tidy randomly I'm doing my days slightly differently today I've got loads of work doing the computer however because I can't bear to have another video of me just with looking completely worth I'm going to do my makeup and before and after I try and do one a week of a foundation before and after I'm going to do that first I've got my camera set up and then I always do my makeup shots and videos on my gray background she did because I just think it's the thing is I know it's it's sort of a boring background but it means that you can see the skin to flee and I sort of think what's the point in telling people here this foundation is great we're numb is that going to stay when you can't even see what it looks like on the skin so I do this in daylight it's just like that look and I do it close up and i don't use any camera kind of trickery is just literally my skin and yeah this is this is where the magic happens people sorry to shatter the illusion yeah I wouldn't normally do this fast I'm doing it because I yeah I need I just need to feel good about myself in at least one vlog oh I've got my mirror I've got my foundation this is the okay so I've got my mirror there I've got my camera and you can see in that little screen that it's just gray behind me such as nice flat background I've got my remote control for the camera my foundation brush and my foundation which is the burberry bright glow foundation and then I should do my before and afters so look I have done my foundation and then basically I've got my remote control and that's how I take my still life pictures of myself still life it's not still life as it face pictures and because I don't like to sort of do things that multitasking I'm going to shoot a mascara before and after at the same time and then I'm going to feel nice and ready for my vlogging it's look sort of hold on she says happy with myself and without makeup on it's just I feel like every single vlog that I've done recently and all of my early pregnancy vlogs on the uphill channel I just look rough yes I oh come on this is nice sometimes to look nice isn't it so bit of foundation on and they're numb bit of mascara and all we've done i'll be happy i just realized all of that was pointless because i don't have my thing over the roof light which means it looks like a on this camera but on I'm a really good camera all the light comes in from the top and you get really dark shadows and it's just really really unflattering lights and waiting for mr. AMR to construct me some kind of thing that i can take up and down to let the light because it's really nice and light coming in when you're trying to work but it's just not good for shooting but i might just get one of those velux some horizontal blinds for reef lights because to be quite honest if you wait for yourself awesome d in the house to do a job just never gets done does it you sort of just need to look someone in and getting to come I always find anyway on with day and as I said before I find that I have to sort of prioritize and just get the things done that need to get done which in today's case is all the posts for a model recommends until next Monday and two posts for the uphill I've just uploaded loads of videos and done those videos so don't need a video which is a saving grace today because that takes ages and ages and ages and also I've got to write synopsis for something that is my main job today but I feel like I can't get my headspace clear enough to do it until I've done all of the other stuff and then there'll be so much admin that comes in so I sort of have to switch off my emails switch I don't get any reception in here anyway so I don't get mobile phone calls but um switch off the email so i can really concentrate and getting stuff done I've got really distracted reading about Brangelina and the breakup and these are the tables i was looking at another day coffee tables for in here I love the fact that things just pop up on your screen to remind you so you can't get away once you start looking at stuff online isn't it that's um two hours that's gone past affability no 33 hours and I literally haven't looked up which is why my eyes start to look like this I have have my glasses on this isn't gonna be that interest in this video is it because on a work day a work work day all I do is sit here head down plow on through hobnob snack bar which is really healthy but will see me through the afternoon and had an apple so you know that sort of balancing things out I've got 20 new whatsapp messages so that will distract me for a while I've got so much to do so much I have to leave for book club in three and a half hours and it's sort of it's borderline ridiculous how much I've got to do actually so I'm going to crack on instead of talking to the camera and then our film things if appropriate really I need to do another video with it's like work but when I'm away or when I'm going into town because then I can do sort of shots of my feet walking along Oxford Street and you know cutaways of people and interesting things this is literally just me haven't remotely done enough work I've been sort of half heartedly tidying and it doesn't look any better that's all recycling that bins got to go out and a lot of my stuff is back in those boxes so for lack of them sort of well what show you some of the things coming out of my makeup bag and some of the things going in so that I can test them this week the wire South bronzing stones I love and but I've written about them already use them loads and loads and so I'm swapping that for the essay edit bronzer which is like a barely born so it's really nice so that goes all there and then I've got highlighter Luminizer undetectable Luminizer I'm really interested in this from make up forever with a brush so that's going in this very weirdlooking mascara from Mac ghulam concealer I've got loads of Real Techniques sponge as I want to try vation from bare minerals which is a powder foundation not normally really my cup of tea but I'm gonna give it a go i'm not sure which shade i am so i'll take both back with me then I've got soap & Glory neutrals pellets and I've got the YSL contouring palette which I think comes with this brush here so pop that in and then the Smashbox can right ready BB so you know I might not get through all of this I like to try stuff loads and really get used to it but I like to have the option and then it's all there and I can just no dig on in what I need to this is a shelf of dreams well not of dreams of nightmares for me this is all sort of stuff that I've don't pop a nut perfume at the front i'm testing have tested i'm trying to test and it's all sort of categorized a lot of a bit skincare things like a feature I want to do on sensitive skin feature one sort of peel pads and things like that on really rich moisturizers I don't know what this section is and this is just a load of mess that I haven't got round to sorting yet today and now this is my sort of neat shell flick see that that I was going to have in the background of my videos but doesn't really show up so it's bit pointless and then down there we've got some sultry autumn sense and some sort of multi masking bespoke face masks and it's all themed so as I think of stuff because there are so many products in the world and as I think of stuff I sort of categorize it and stick it into little areas I mean it is chaotic but it's sort of organized chaos I've really done badly at my tidying today but I've sort of had a lot of admin problems I've got distracted so that's pretty much my work day I've got a lot done um I have to say but um days with baby are a lot more happy that you know what it's really difficult because I love having the time to do my work but a whole day I'm like I really want to see the baby and then if I have a whole day with

"no_A Day In The Life New York With Lily  The Anna Edit.txt"	"my god Wow I just sat down to start the vlog but then I looked out the window and a massive cruise ship is pulling into New York and I felt like I should show you because the car is massive so I've become a bit obsessive like looking at the boats and stuff good morning and welcome to a brand new vlog you know people start these and they're like just woken up but they have like a full face makeup on and they really haven't just woken up I really have just woken up so apologies if there's any kind of like crusty eye business going on right now and but yeah lily and I are in New York and this route our room is honestly the nicest most incredible hotel room I've ever stayed in in my entire life I'm obsessed me and Lily just want to stay here for like a month I mean I'm sure that would cost like you have to win the lottery to do that but if so so beautiful we're staying in one Brooklyn one hotels but the Brooklyn one which is why we've got the amazing view over Manhattan and it's just beautiful we're here with West Elm and for a couple of days and then Lillian I'd like extended it ourselves for a couple of days and we've honestly had the best time I'm filming this on Wednesday and we've been here since kind of Monday afternoon and we have honestly had so much fun like on the flight over Lynn I just chatted to each other for like a solid five hours was everyone around us just got annoyed that we would never going to shut up and then we cried until we laughed because we cried until we last note were way around we laughed until we cried because we're in a taxi and the taxi driver played avril lavigne complicated and we love that song we should have so many like funny moments like good stories already it's been such laughs and yesterday we went to the West Elm HQ which was just I mean it was amazing like if I if I had kind of a office job and I didn't do this I was a hundred percent want to work that it has the most amazing views over the Manhattan Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge it was just it was unreal like I just kept looking out the window and being like I can't believe you guys work here with that view like and you also have like ridiculously cool jobs it was so incredible as we had look at their like full and full that autumn and winter collection and it looks really nice all their Christmas stuff and VA yesterday we had kind of a West Elm day and then today we've just got a free day which is amazing and I'm not really a hundred social what we're going to do it's currently about six o'clock in the morning because I booked on to do some reformer Pilates classes whilst I'm here I feel like the exercise classes in New York just so good and it's always really fun to kind of join in do something different I mean all we're going to do all date is eat and so it's nice to kind of balance that out the people watching is amazing at them and I did one yesterday it was actually really bloody hard and I've managed to convince Lily I think to come to stage one I know she's awake we've been what's up E and she said what something that she hasn't confirmed her attendance yet she's you can see how she feels but hopefully she'll come through reform philosophies and we can go and do that like this morning and just take it off then I think we're going to go to Manhattan we haven't actually been on the main island yet but we haven't been able a and I think we're just going to have like shopping date really haven't been to New York for a good like year or two so she was like I want to treat all the places I think we're just going to go fill up with shopping bags and yeah I thought I would take you along for the ride and show you a day in New York it started pretty early let's just take a moment for the lobby look proper lily and I came down yesterday and we just like chill out here and did some work and it was oh my gosh they gorgeous looking it up online and everything Lily pick she did it they promoted you yeah I'm done it yet yeah just gets me very wake up this morning I was like oh my god I can't feel my whole midsection oh girl and yeah but it's cool to be eight loads price yes thank you you're so so so good I thought I posted pictures right and a little hook I'm crazy for it I should have taken photos post pictures rise moron yeah and that now we're in Brooklyn Heights which has heels yes am I saying appeal yeah you say he'll fine you should get a heel shoe didn't work here he'll kill yes he'll I'm trying me I think Assad has animated one I just smashed my face with water if I press my pieces like yeah that's going to have to be and we will check in when we no longer consider like midsection I'll order my going shopping day today we did it yeah and it was good Lillian message she saw it was okay it was a teacher of mine see she was lying deliverance yeah just like a very chilled relax relax man everyone in there and very like relax and chill we were just talking about how when we were doing especially after we felt like our bodies are like this collection like you know today I was like mimics overnight formula oh my goodness from Donna I was taking my favorite thank you I know I was I can really was there's some really hard ones let me put teaser and it's horrible but it was good and now we really want to eat and french toast I've come to Lily's room and guess what she's watching oh you're seeing things the way she's so happy she absolutely loves it I'm annoyed Lee Lily ordered her food before like quite a lot before line 28 and mine came first so she's upset about it but look at this you ready Oh survey I have now been in Lily's room for like what 45 minutes well yes 45 minutes and she's got me into love island and the whole world about there we super popper over then I think their names Buckman folk I want to know the backstory we might never leave that this could just be a vlog of the hotel were much just watching applies okay so when it meant that Long Island is like so crafted it that this is all business I definitely just wanted to note over the whole episode I don't know I need to finish getting ready because you know we got shopping to do so think the plan is to head to the like Soho area of town we're staying in Brooklyn so we haven't actually been on the main of Manhattan bit just yet and I think we're going to go over there that's me where I stayed last time I came to New York and it's just such a good area the shopping we obviously want to go to glossier which is kind of ridiculous but I think I made four trips there last fucking slice game I don't think there's anything else but I possibly need although I do need to pick up some repurchases of some things and I actually think there'll be some kind of New York related blog posts to go with this blog and I was thinking it would probably be like a New York Hall so they'll be a blog post click down below and it'll be New York release it'll be either that alternative food I have done a New York City guide before so make sure that link down below see also link down below will be you've guessed it and platform with link can because a new episode would've online today and it would have been the episode with Giovanna Fletcher which was so cool I basically want to be her like best friend I feel like if when I ever have children I feel like she would be a very good woman tonight she's very cool it spoke to her about writing books how she got into YouTube being money online all those sorts of things and it was really nice to get to know her and shit a lovely home as well and the little surprise guest which was really fun and so yeah that was a good fit I hope you liked it I can't believe there's only one episode left and living I are hopefully filming it a couple of days after this going live I think that's quite a quick turnaround and that it's someone who we've known for a very long time I think you'll know her as ever you want to give too much away in case maybe maybe what you have to we don't know these things are all very up in the air to what the last minute till they actually happen so who knows but the last one I think that we're not in time so I hope you are excited for that let me know if you have any guesses ok so this is my day to outfit I've got a weekday from a sauce just like black like a high neck tshirt I just rolled it up and put a hair band in it so I've got an emergency hair and if I need it and then this is my and Other Stories skirt you guys know I love the skirt the slip I've got quite high so I sort of have to do it down every now and again but it's very nice and slow to you when it's warm outside I've got my selected femme espadrilles on maybe because they're the most comfortable shoes I have and yes they we walked there like eight miles or something crazy eight miles and a reference and then I got my sign around bag dick movies from glasses smooth and I yeah now we're going merely looking here around the bridge it looks amazing to carry over it now look at her yeah mark could have look about the prints they tell us is very homemade but the blade really like I have the windows me and Lenny like the cross we like this sort of life we're going to know one screen about that I literally had fucking shit we've been in Sephora for about three hours okay shit another and we just need a ride eh we need to leave we're going to be something like we're just assessing Lily's situation everyone I won't ruin your whole this is what we going to go through now hold it I will admit I mean I am also getting really different money I will admit that your bag does look a little bit full there isn't really much going on in mine but I have decided broad place to go for

showing her Lily's crib there's lots of Wow's going on some back in my room now I'm just going to get ready I think we're gonna go for some sushi but I thought whilst my room was clean and cozy I

got a French judge on three classes of them instead hello and so I have finished that what then I've left most like a new friend I didn't know anyone who was there it really does are how you can be intimidated by people who do exactly the same thing as you do I don't know why I noticed that who I saw that's a bit of a loner be honest myself a little bit looser it was a really cool event and the new swatch and items are really for the performance it was like an interpretive dance kind of thing which is pretty cool really different I see I've never been that as log event there it's been like

oh good I mean I wouldn't recommend looking or driving someone get the maple syrup because this essay is utter waffle okay I went to the library my college library from all Ballack half a tutor o'clock my legs are exhausted from walking around London all day yesterday like I'm literally so unfair I've got blisters all over my feet from my shoes eventually I will learn that if you don't wear socks and then walk around all day you will get blisters occasionally bloggers like myself um really really fortunately are sent things from very strange brands I've been really lucky this week and I've received quite a few deliveries and so I thought I'd do a little bit of blogger nails and if that's all right with you so fastly and new look very kindly sent me a few bits first up I've got these jogger trouser things these are my new favorite things now like jogger material but they look like trousers so you could wear them to any small event and be super comfortable it's like taking your pajamas around with you all day is I just so comfy then they sent me this running part which is kind of like a subtle color and I feel like you could wear this without constantly being like having the jokes made oh well where's your body gone where's your body gone you know I think it's really cool I'm trying to get back into running so that is definitely going to motivate me to go I've meant to go this morning and I mean I didn't next up one of my favorite pieces and I'm from Neelix is this shirt so this is a really nice um color I can imagine bit like with rolledup sleeves and like boating with a tshirt or wrapped around your waist I think that wasn't really cool and it will definitely be used for both of those things then I have a cream kind of roller this is a really nice kind of offwhite I think this is really good first layering type of that person under tshirt and speaking of which this tshirt and you could wear that with anything such major things just throw on so thank you very much new look I look forward to styling those items and stay tuned to my blog for that next up it's quite a few here and this one I believe is from Orion lab series and I've got some grooming products here so we've got water charged gel cream a future rescue Repair Serum and finally and urban blue detox clay mask now this is really cool I love the packaging this has got that in New York skyline and as you may know New York is very did my heart my skin has been really really bad this last week so I'm looking forward to saving my skin so thank you that series for looking after me because I can't do it myself next up I got some gift bags from the event so I went yesterday so firstly we have Zuzu man the beauty man that was really cool they're launching their new line of tailoring and it's so nice there are these pinstriped trousers which I need so in here we've got some creek can't go wrong laughter then hey what oh this is really cool Evo shavers and it's so highly that's perfect travel size thank you very much and next we have I did such a bad job of that let me try again the skin connection I'll conclude with that bye swatch and this is the other end lemon tea so desperately not to rip it we don't the kind of pipe is up and all the watches laughs like what incredible and if I have any three cyclist I love these as a fans so annal multifunctional and the other thing in here it's very interesting it's a flat spot time oh my god so swatch have given me one of the new watch I want it on right now next up we have this one is a very intriguing sheet and I mean it's a boxy shape bubble wrap okay so nice I've got two portable charges from the brand box also this onto desk charger which you can plug Wow like five different devices in and then this point is a portable charger which I really could have used yesterday because my phone and ran out of battery on the train home but I vote for next time so thank you very much box that is lovely I can't refuse those and then we have this one and it is big and purple and fragile apparently look at this so this we're sensing by Cadbury let me show you cremate essential this chocolate bunny cool it's popping candy flavor oh my god and then there's these mini bunnies and you could put these ones like so when you have your Easter Sunday roast in it you could put one of these on everyone's plate now this is great so these may just look like a normal pack of mini eggs but in here there are eight mini bags of mini eggs which is perfect because I am so busy and I will buy one of those recaps of mini eggs which is like a share pack and just eat the whole thing because I cannot stop myself that is the perfect size packet of mini eggs so the great I mean it wouldn't be Easter without an Easter Egg at home this year and Cadbury are doing a heroes Easter egg which is really cool because of the heroes it's like they're kind of selection box so you've got the caramel swirl Sarge cream egg whisper that is amazing that one really cool idea and easter egg chocolate is just the best chocolate then I have this now this is again one of the core things as an additive everything is the coolest thing in the side possibly is basically an Easter egg hunt for lazy people it's amazing a Cadbury chocolate is just lit and finally are you ready for an egg and spoon Oreo what it's like they combines the two best things and just made them into one superior thing like all other chocolate brands can just stop now because Cadbury just one and then my camera battery died and I just wanted to say a massive massive thank you to all of the lovely brands who was so generous and said anything and I appreciate that a lot I'll leave all the links to all those products below if you want to check them out do so

"no_A Day In The Life The Best Year Ever  The Anna Edit.txt"	"good morning and welcome to a brand new weekly vlog I will say this one might not be as cheery is my normal ones because I've been feeling very well I ate out maybe two days ago two nights ago now and something just didn't at all agree with me like I haven't been sleeping very well without going into too much detail so I've been feeling a bit sorry for myself but as Mark said last night he said have you been drinking enough water and I was like probably not and he raised his hand to me and he is like I don't want to hear it until you've been replenishing your hydration sources and you've been drinking lots of water so I've got some squash cuz I'm a child so I'm trying to drink less water let myself feel better and yesterday was a bit of a write off I did some stuff I think is that doing anything was better than nothing but it definitely wasn't my most productive or positive day but today I'm like no I have to give next week hopefully of Lynnea ago a noise calm she's going to be doing some work out there and I'm basically just going on with her for the ride slash on the stage one pulling her on so we're doing that next week and then the week after that we're going to New York on a trip so there's a lots going on so this is my kind of final week to like get shit done so by the time you see this up on Wednesday lily and I will be away and I don't think I'm going to vlog from Stockholm because I did one before and I think we're doing something like quite similar things and lose their job so you know she'll be plugging in so there definitely be something up on her channel but I think the New York one will probably be up two weeks from now so there will be like a Anna gets out the house becoming food because yeah I'm like oh my god all I seem to do in these vlogs is just hang around the flat I'd like do you work which is very boring for you I'm sure but hey it's realistic and manage life sometimes so this is another edition of Anna leaves the house to do Pilates I'm really not much house but I'm hopefully gonna spice up because today when this video goes live marks one year exactly since I rebranded the blog and like resource started it all as that Anna edit I can't believe it's been a year but then I also can't believe it's only been a year sort of feels like it's been the Anna edit forever but I felt sort of throughout this vlog I would talk through some of my highlights of the last year as I'll show you some of my favorite clips from the vlogs like a little this is your life style yearly and you'll look back I don't know one is actually terrifying this life is too big smart keeps using it's like chocolate carrot some like what are you doing its massive he's coming though like I said I know I keep banging on about this but I just had a lot of at home time and that has been very advantageous to my sort of game and being productive and today I need a video video that you guys will see on Sunday it's basically going to be a kind of a home office tour so I thought I'd show you a bit of behind the scenes I will check in when I have something interesting to say some other news to update you on I know I don't normally show you the bathroom because it's just my least favorite room of the flat and it needs some renovation so we started the renovation if I hated being in my bathroom before I mean now it's like a whole new level of gross and disgusting so I literally I like running have a shower and like run out again but I did want to show you something here because I've got something new and my skincare routine actually two new things I can be doing a blog post on these scenes and keep an eye out for that I did a bit of a Selfridges haul and it picked up this I actually think it's out of stock on Selfridges now which is really annoying because there's new basically everyone was buying it but it is the dr. jar Sarah midden so I'm meeting Caroline lobster Lily really loves it she kept going on about so I thought it'd be nice to have another option especially this one's good for travel I really like the glossy a priming moisturizer rich and I say this is quite similar but just easier to travel with because in tube and it's lighter and smaller start it's very good and then also this oh my god it's another doctor gel this is the premium BB multiaction skin care and makeup SPF well it's 45 what around that and I think this was only about 30 pounds and I didn't realize just how tinted it would be like it properly it's like foundation basically I used to use the water fuse back in the day like the greeny one and that was always really good this is supposedly like the premium one with like more skin care benefits and I don't know it's got more coverage but it definitely feels like it's got more coverage in it but it's really really nice just super impressed with this because I always sit and do my makeup and stuff I will spare you that footage but I thought I would just show you a quick before so this is before I use this and then I will show you after and also I had my brows on the other day finally I literally felt like a new woman if you didn't Jamie she was laughing because I was smiling I just like had like a smile on my face because she was trimming them brows she was doing all the good things and it felt so good my eyebrows I've got to put my than an itchy it was horrible and so they've had the tint put three them so I always think they look a bit like wool a bit Angry Birds for like the first kind of three or four days which we're in right now so by next week they would have her definitely gone down I also got my lashes lifted as well I love it look at that I haven't even used an eyelash curler the dream literally dream but before and then I'll show you after this is after I don't know if it's gonna look any different on camera and I've got kind of a couple of patches of redness which will go down in like minutes or so but I just feel like it evens everything out it's kind of nice and glowy it's got a bit of warmth in it which I appreciate because I have not been fake tanning this summer at all so I kind of appreciate that little bit of glow it's got in it and I just feel like put some mascara on purple lip balm on basically you're done I'm gonna leave my makeup here because I'm going to Pilates this morning then coming back then filming a video so I will do a full face then I'm just sitting and editing or what I've already filmed and I just also sort out my expenses August August expenses as always really fun so just a bit of admin II kind of stuff I thought I would start with my first highlight of the past year and why I think that the past year has been absolutely awesome now don't get me wrong shit things have happened in the last year as well but I felt like overall it was a very good year and I feel like as I near my 30s by just a much more sure of myself I'm not sure that's the right way of putting it but I just think something like Twix and you kind of don't really do not don't really care as much it's not the right thing I dunno what I mean like you just sort of chill out a bit more in just a bit more sure of yourself you're more sure of what you want out of life like where it's going and I guess overall it's been a very happy year so the first kind of big memory is actually launching that unedited because I was shitting myself like I'd sat on that name and the whole like website and everything being new and the logos and everything for about nine months I think I actually bought the domain in Christmas time and then we launched it kind of I think I was there for this date was the 30th August so it was a whole nine months I've just sort of sitting on it and waiting and not being a hundred percent happy with what I was sitting at that time because I knew that it was going to take time for the new thing to happen so I was so terrified just cuz it's really scary it's like a big change and then the angles make up I'd had for so long that's very makeup based and this was definitely moving into something that was more like lifestyle and not ask Beauty focused it was kind of terrifying but it just really felt like the right thing to do and I'm so so so so thankful for your guys reactions because you were just you couldn't have been nicer about it literally the the general dude was like yeah of course like this makes so much sense for you and it's just the right move to make and yeah that was very terrifying and we actually spend a couple of days before we launched the new vlog in Stockholm our comments calm we're supposed to go with our friends and sadly one of our friends lost her passport before we left but only realised like a couple of days before us and they couldn't come with us it shame but we had a really good time out there and whenever I've watched that vlog because sometimes I do you watch my blogs backs I'm an absolute leader especially the travel ones because they're just nice to relive those memories and that vlog just fills me with excitement when I watch chicks we had such a good time when we were there I'm so excited that I get to go back again like when you see this video me and Lily will be there and so I'm so excited I get to get backs I just think it's one of my favorite cities it's so lovely and peaceful and relaxed and the people are lovely the weather was pretty good when we were there and it's just a very beautiful place so it was that coupled with the fact that I would then come back to the hotel room and sit and have a Skype with the web designer Jay as he would like to show me what I actually had to do on the website so it was a really exciting time whenever I think of calm I think of the Anna edit rebirth I think of eating lots of Swedish red fish which is why the best Suites ever and it was a very exciting time so I've left the house I'm a bit worried this ain't bad it's gonna happen I don't feel very well I didn't rub my sunglasses but I did forget a hairband so and this is it's not boding well we're also very worried I'm gonna let out some kind of like atomic toxic fart that's gonna cause people to pass out or some things I I'll keep you updated because I'm sure that's something that you're hoping to be updated on parties update I survived and the first 15 minutes was just pure ABS which are the most delicate part of my body right now so that was a bit hard and afterwards I think I looked a bit pale in the face but I got through it came back soaked my dad on the way home ended up seeing him for like an hour on the phone there's something that I'm working on I've got an idea and I completely didn't match up the dots that he is the right person to talk to about this he knows so much about this topic it was amazing it had a really good coming up with ideas concepts he was just chatting away and it was very helpful and very lucky to have parents that are just very supportive of what I do and my dad especially is very helpful and very involved in what I do and that's just really nice so now I'm gonna eat some lunch but I thought I was throwing another quick memory and I actually like I didn't do vlogmas last year but I did do for lots of weekly vlogs in the runup Christmas so I did kind of christen slugs and I just really loved them I thought that was a really nice way of doing vlogmas but not as intense and especially because this year we're gonna be away I'm gonna be having my little like monthlong digital detox so there won't be any Christmas content this year but the Christmas content from last year is kind of cute and there's a section where mark and I are putting up the tree and whenever I watch that it just makes you feel very nostalgic I'm very happy and I think mark is great that's about Safi isn't gonna get but I think Christmas is always a really interesting time because there's no kids and I found me at the moment like me and my sister no one has kids and I just feel like there's probably not gonna be a load of Christmases like this will be a couple of Christmases where we haven't got kids but having kids at Christmas just seems like the best thing and I'm so excited for that so in a couple years time hopefully there'll be a kid or two and I am so excited for that moment so it's quite nice to enjoy these like kid free adult Christmases and because hopefully they'll be cute people think I'm pregnant now I talk about kids people like oh my god that means you're like pregnant now no definitely not for like another year or two or three but I just know that Stage four I'm like looking forward to that moment and my friend who has a kid it is super adorable but go give me a couple years yet this is quite a random lunch but basically just using lots of stuff up I had some avocado tease up so I just smashed it up kind of made like a mini guacamole I had some veggie burgers they're very burn just reheated those thought I'd have it with an egg and of course lots of tomato ketchup because it's the best condiment in the whole entire world just filmed a home office tour there you go there's my camera on the floor yeah there you go that was actually surprisingly easier than I thought it was one of those things that in my head was going to take like a last film and I needed like someone to come and help me with like a fancy gimbal camera something or rather you know I mean but actually it was so much more relaxed and chilled just to do it on my own with the tripod and I think I think it's gonna turn out alright so that'll be up on Sunday but filming the outrage of that video reminds me of two things the first thing of which is that of course there's a blog post go this video as always I'll make sure it linked down below for you but it's basically just a look back on like last year and why I felt the need to change my name and just kind of about yeah terrified I was and how I felt like it was the right thing to do and looking back on it a year later and being like yes that went very well I'm very lucky and thank you to you lots so definitely check that out and we recreated the photos from the original post of like welcome to the edits that was so funny like our palm tree is so much bigger I feel very proud of our palm and the second thing is about the newsletter because the newsletter is happening it's written it's being designed and I should have a signup link by the time this video goes live hopefully I said that in my last vlog and it wasn't ready and people were like oh my god what's going on my says link it should be ready I don't want to have to regret saying that but if it is it will be in the description box and you'll be like when you go to the Anna radio kind of homepage there should be a section on there so hopefully that is there but time to throw another highlight of the last year at you I love doing this and I still can't believe that she did it I went to Thailand on my own I think was back in February time it was for a retreat and I did know Samus Anna was there you know my friends on a van Dijk the really tall blond one who's like super fit and amazing I'm going away with her actually in October I'm very excited for it and but she was training over there in this retreat is New Horizons like health retreat I've done a blog post on it I've done a blog and there's a little loads of content from it but it was actually so much fun it was kind of terrifying I'm not the biggest fan of flying and flying for I think I was like an 18hour flight in total I took three flights there three flights back on my own managed to navigate myself around obviously once I was there I was with the group of people as Anna actually traveling on my own was really quite fun I don't know I quite like to definitely do it again highly recommend and you just feel so badass at the end of it because oh I did on my own go go and also the retreated so I met such lovely ladies a couple of whom I'm still in contact with now because they were just so nice like one of them Catherine especially we message all the time and I feel really lucky to have met such lovely moon doing it and we just worked out an a and explored Koh Samui and I did things like paddleboarding we did lots of hikes it was just really he really fun that was definitely a highlight Vishal I was on a bit of an editing role but I was just waiting for some footage to be uploaded and I thought oh I see what's going on on Spotify because sometimes when I'm just waiting for like things that to happen they going to take five minutes it's really fun just put on a song and sing really loud because no one in the house right now although I'm pretty sure the nextdoor neighbors are in their garden and would be able to hear me so went on the throwbackthursday play this because it is Thursday and it is so good it's called I've actually downloaded it I thought I need this playlist it says this week it's a singalong indie hits take over Kate Nash foundations it's basically on my teenage like angsty relationships just in one song it's so good it really takes me back and I just love it and sing it really loudly and it's got Klaxons on it electric fill empty Vampire Weekend The Strokes we've got panic at the disco can't stand me now The Libertines I've downloaded this because I feel like this would be a really good thing to listen to you and Mark and I are in New Zealand on like really long road trips because he will like those songs oh okay foundations it's just I love that song so much so the hair is going up in the head and that is how you know that things I've got a serious vibe just edited and uploaded and sketch of that Home Office which I'm really surprised I really think I get that done today I'm still not feeling too great but yeah that managed I don't know how it happened but I'm really Chappell that is all ready to go and I'm just gonna answer up some emails before Mike gets home but I thought I would talk you through another highlight of the year which has definitely been going to New York like I don't know it is weird like last year for some reason I ended up going to LA a few times I think I went twice last year which is just I never thought that going to LA like twice in a year but because I can never happen in my lifetime let alone like in a job sort of setting but for some reason New York is where it's not this year and I've already been twice I'm actually going again in a week's time which is completely nuts but I love it it's so nice to go back to these cities and repeatedly because then you could live like a local and that is my favorite thing to do when I go away it obviously it's lovely to see the sights and go on Sam's and all those kinds of things but with New York because I think I've been about six times in total now it's I've done those things but Vince the Statue of Liberty I've done in Central Park all of that is actually a vlog from when I went with Mark and it was Mark's first time there so we did all of those things I literally was just taking off that tourist list so because I've done them I don't feel guilty for not doing them every time I go back and it's just nice to like go to Pilates classes and go to cafes and restaurants and just wander around at the 10 that you lift there but you just got the day off work like getting your nails done get my nails on a paint box the last time I went was seriously so nice because that way it's just really relaxing because you just feel like you're a New Yorker with a day off I absolutely love it and it was so nice to go with Lilly as well like a month or two ago we just had so much fun there and it's great to hang out with her friend Keisha and we did lots of eating the Bond Street sushi is still something that I think about now and what I really hope we get to go next time we go back as well cuz it was just so lovely but it's just been real nice to get to know another city a bit more I just think it's a lovely city always have a good laugh over there I mean obviously the shopping is amazing but it is it's just like a nice film and it september's a really lovely time to go the weather is perfect so I'm really looking forward to going in like two weeks on the market home and we're cooking dinner and I cooked a dinner from this time it is Vanagon diet katma my pal it's Herbert strong and we are making this which is a lemon and dill Pollock or sweet potato and beet root mass except our live a supermarket didn't have polyps that we're having it caught and it was on special so it's cheap yeah and also I'm not putting the dinner on it because I just don't be new ideal that much yeah it's me it's a bit fennely and I'm like not sure how I feel about that and so Marcus back from work oh yeah in today's book I've been talking about my I passed yeah oh that Anna what would you say is your biggest I like it married that wasn't a prompting that was good people I'm I'm I like T I've been doing them in chronological order with the wedding is the final one yes my highlight to it was awesome the American yeah when there's love it could be a whole year oh yeah then I take the longest maybe we should obviously memory should have a celebratory milk we're gonna end it here because it's time for dinner and I'm really really hungry and then we're probably just going to watch hot summer in bed which is what I say at the end of every vlog but I promise you the next vlog is gonna be it's the fun one is that actually gonna be like drugstore based they'll be a whole they'll be recommendations I think you'll love it and then after that I promise that'd be a fun one where it actually venture outside and but thank you so much for watching I hope I haven't been too grumpy and I will see you on Sunday with that home of this war see you then bye bye"	4620
"no_A Day In The Life What I Eat In A Day  The Anna Edit.txt"	"I love you hi everyone welcome to a brand new vlog I hope you all well I hope you're having a very good week so far this feels really weird because I've like got you in my office right now but I thought I would rescue there and I thought today's video to give it a bit of structure I would do a bit of a what I eat in a day I haven't done one of these for a really long time I got a tweet from someone the other day and she was like I'd love to do the recipes that you make in your videos so I thought that's what I would show you today and a little bit of backstory also a bit of an excuse because this video was supposed to be a New York flog but one of the days Lily blogged and obviously don't want to vlog the same day another day was basically a carbon copy of this exact same day that I've logged last time I went to the glossier showroom I think we even went to the same place for dinner and then the other day we spent half of our day in a place that you can film so the vlog didn't really happen but definitely check out Lily's videos because she's got a New York vlog of a really fun day that we have there coming up very soon so check out but instead I thought I would hopefully send you a bit of an apology with lots of food and also something a bit different instead of just sitting and watching me like type in my laptop and a bit of backstory on my current food situation I have fed my body junk for like solidly the last month if not longer I'm starting to feel a bit like a slug I just don't feel that great and obviously being away for practically like the last few weeks I basically ate french toast every morning a like pizza just all the junk food it was great and I loved it but at the same time I also loved how my body feels when I'm just nourishing it a bit better so today's menu is gonna be a bit of a hard reset I saw Laura from buying our blog late to mention that in Instagram story and I was like that is exactly what my body needs right now so I'm all for balance I don't you think that I eat like this every single day because I definitely don't like yesterday I've basically just a sugary cereal but at that point where I'm like no I need to get some nutrients in my body I need to get lots of fruit and veg in my body and so that is what today is all about if like me you too love food and I've been basically doing the junk food diet the last few weeks months years whatever if you want to do a hard reset with me and if you're addicted to sugar and need to like calm it down then this is what I do and I kind of need to press reset and just give my body what it want and there's nothing that I cut out or avoid is definitely like an everything in moderation kind of things they just cuz I'm not eating so I'm making this video doesn't mean it that I avoid it I am all for balance know what makes you feel great and knowing what makes you feel absolutely rotten so yeah that's just a bit of facts right I want you to think but I just need like four federal day every day because I definitely don't like yesterday it was all about cinnamon grams and it was great but yeah I'm at that point where I need I need some vitamins and minerals in my body so for breakfast I just kept it really simple I've just got some Greek yogurt with some strawberries raspberries and blueberries and then I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna cook up for lunch and I might also try and do dinner at the same time as well basically just prep everything for the day everything is going to be like homemade from scratch I'm actually really up for it but today it's a photography day so I'm gonna throw in like a little bit of vlogging as we go but mainly why in a day so know number one yes so it's pretty early in the morning but I'm gonna get started with lunch because I really want to make a vegetable soup because like I said I've got Lauren my photographer girl coming around today and she is feet and this way we can eat the same for lunch and it's basically just like a kind of vegetable soup with all the vegetables I like so I don't have to like hide anything in there and then loads and loads of beans oh my word this smells so good I cut up some sweet potatoes I did actually buy a bag of precut carrots which I know is the laziest thing ever but hey you don't they look really uniform I've got some peppers in there as well white onions a load of garlic possibly about eight cloves and there's some chili in there and then I put a bit of paprika salt pepper on top just order it with a bit of olive oil and then I've just given it a good stir but now I'm just gonna roast this in the oven on about 200 for about half an hour there is a recipe that I'm following right now so I made sure that it's linked down and just going box view down below so in my massive pan which might just be the best thing that I've ever purchased if I can find it online I'll link it down below but honestly it's so good for things like this I've put in two tins of chopped tomatoes a bit of salt a bit of pepper I've got a veggie stock cube ready to go those are my cashew nuts that are soaking they've been soaking overnight therefore the curry later on then I'm going to do a little bit of mustard a bit of Worcestershire sauce is a bit of coconut sugar just a tiny bits kind of sweetened art that's all gonna go in there along with my B switch they just rinsed I think I've got bored silly cannellini and butter beans so I'm basically just gonna throw that all in here get that cooking and then when my veggies are done I will either throw them in the food processor I'm not sure just to like thin it out of it or I'll just throw them in there and do more of like a chunky soup I don't know so you have a sear we fill with this one we've spent the morning shooting and we managed to do like three outfit pictures in an hour I changed in the car it was very classy Lauren is here I'm feeding her my soup she's game she's like garlic it I was like yeah it's got eight claimsmade minimum and so about to have that I'd given myself got nice hearty amount there but I've made enough sleep for about 50 tea people so I think I'll be eating this around a week my camel coat that I ordered as part of my little capsule wardrobe rejigged has arrived and I absolutely love it it's from whistles I turn it around so you can have a look so chat with like the color and the length and the style I like that it has a wrap around if I need it too it makes it a bit more trench coat in a little bit more fitted and structured which is what I tend to like in my clothing but without is definitely more of like a duster vibe so I'll link it down below for you and I got it directly off the whistles website and it came within like two days of my Barney I'm so happy I'm just always happy when I'm in my dressing gown but it took me about half an hour maybe just to clear up everything that we've done we'd kind of had different setups all around the flats so I just cleaned up that and then I just heard the super way and annoying me that was like this much left it just wouldn't fit in the Tupperware box otherwise and so I'm gonna have that now some feeling a bit peckish still and I think I might maybe have some dried fruit not this is the part of the day where I just wants a flaming hot monstermunch lily and I have been talking about flamin hot months lunch for like the last two weeks we've been traveling around and we've been making each other crazy so much so I will give into that craving but not today but I will show you if I have any snacks after this I'm procrastinating from emptying the dishwasher so instead I got myself some fruit and nut so I've got some dried apricots in there fun fact used to think that dried apricots were disgusting yeah and then I think that has some in France or something they tasted like nature's candy like they were literally like sweets so I really enjoy those we've got some dried apples and then some cashew nuts and also some Brazil nuts in there as well so hopefully that should keep me going till dinner time because the time now it is ha 3 and we've got Pilates at 7:00 whenever I work out I try not to eat in the four hours before for no other reason than otherwise it makes me feel sick and I feel like I haven't digested my food and I feel like it's all like jiggling around and look I just it's just not good so for me I'm kind of breaking it really this is my cut offer because it's Pilates I'm like oh I'd be teaching early around E so this is still like three and a half hours to digest when's your time many hours have passed and if I'm honest for having a real mare with dinner it is now quarter to nine we went out and did an exercise class and the idea was when we'd be back this curry would be ready amazingly it's got bit of like non cook able potato in it it just don't monitor don't want to cook I mean it was from this book the over she blows cookbook by Angela Lydon and it's the creamy vegetable curry it's supposed to look a little bit like that and then it doesn't look terribly not like that but now it's just got little bits of like burn kind of in it as well because the bottom keeps burning this this close to ordering do you know what though I've been reading this book oh this is a terrible idea lemon poppy seed lemon poppy seed muffins how good do they look like oh they're amazing the cherry bomb cookbook I got this when I was in New York with Bobby Brown but honestly it's like the worst thing to read when you're hungry so all the recipes look ridiculously amazing oh okay before I show you dinner I'm gonna make this whole wheat chocolate chip cookies a toasted walnuts look at that that looks like LaVon bakery oh my word Marty no I think it looks really nice play Thanks I don't think it looks terrible mark some he has none I'm having mine with rice I did in a bags I'm lazy reggae and there is my dinner mmm mmm we're gonna go and eat this and watch Great British Bake Off which I am so excited about this is lemon highlight of my day happening right now thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this not so much bloody this time but hopefully a bit of an insight into ye when I'm trying not to eat cookies all day but I'm definitely gonna make that baby looks so good I can't stop looking at the picture of them if there's recipes or anything that I've made on my face and linked down below as I said this is a very healthy day for me I feel good for it it's good to eat lots of veggies sometimes and I hope you enjoy and I'll see on Sunday with a brand new video that has Lilian I edited it the other day thank you guys my mother is hilarious it's hilarious you're my own horn I hope see that bye"	2287

review I've done like an actual true of you I've never done that before on my blog of these because I am obsessive em guy made a comment tonight and he was like you know I know she is because I literally warned them like every single time I could possibly ever wear heels they're like princess oh my god those stain they are literally princess shoes I'm obsessing them found a few different versions these but they still have a few sizes left of these on Luiza via Romans I'll link them down below actually just read my blog post pass and then you'll see if they're the kind of shoe for you these are honestly the most beautiful shoes I think I've ever owned just to put this in perspective you I've never kept a shoe in a box before I always take the box when I throw the Box away I probably have countless messages and I have never ever kept a shoe in a box because just oh oh my gosh they're not real I mean those are never staying the light keeps reflecting off some religious themes I mean imagine looking down at your feet and seeing this oh my gosh by the way it all up my fake tan but that's not what we're looking at right now because look up us oh it is great good time I've been so bad in my skin easily it's really lazy and not good although to try to get back into having a proper skin routine is about three ones you don't like it this stuff is unreal it is the envy organics gentle Queen Samantha it is so good if you have unhappy skin if you just need this in your life it is like hydrating and calming and soothing and nourishing this is my third one by the way this is a massive product for me and then the rose hydrating mist I use that as well and tonight I'm going to use my glam Bloustein art which is such a good overnight hydrator I love it if you travel or you go on longhaul flight you need that in your life so we know why I'm sending still my dress I just have that urge to become a makeup I mean look at that spot can you see that it's pretty huge it's one of those under the skin hunts if I coming out and get me and eat my faith alive is why I saw this spot coming out like you know are this is just me been asking for it because I've been so bad at my finger recently oh my god sorry sorry spotting the balloon doesn't scream on you my cleansing routine where debugged people panic because at a time I have that so I really need to oversee put it behind my head and I don't take off my jewelry and I don't take my clothes but but I would say when I get home and I can make up one I've had my makeup on now for over 12 hours I'm just like I it's just my sub priority of this like get it off right now now I'm going to do with my Rose hydrating mist oh gosh it's also good and roughly is the last step and my face is now seen something super exciting just rise and put up on my insta story the other day that I was looking for these and someone replied and sent me a link to the real real and I never had them before I think it's like vests the air collector just put the US version I can't eat this fricking tag off because I know I can't return them but one goes think that Chanel they're from I think it's like through 2016 and they have pearls around the outside and I just think they're so beautiful you won't have one they were looking for they did in on one but I can another row of pearls on the top but what do we think do we like them or does it look like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory guy whatever is that person's name is you know what I mean mmm interesting they all kind of cool though they honestly feel a little bit flimsy us here there's like look they just feel a little bit flimsy and I have a couple pairs of Chanel sunglasses and then not this flimsy so I think I might take him to the store and ask if they can verify that they're real okay guys speaking of haul I wanted to show you that we've had a bit of a Duke saga today and let me just put this up we've literally had the biggest saga because do you came back to the part with some disgusting bone that he found and basically wanted to eat it and I had to like bribe him to get rid of it and really disgusting so now he's a bit mad at me because I could go into spoon anyway look what I have to show you ah I did some shopping and I want to show you what I got because I haven't looked at it properly and trying anything on yet and if you wanted to get some shoes no no that's a lie I wanted to get this dress so I saw the shoes and other photo shows and mesokurtic such a good return policy so I was like you know what I'll just buy them and then if I don't like them I can return them it's very easy I really want some white heels and a white bag looking for a white box bag so if anyone knows any really gorgeous white box by please let me know I don't want to spend like too much on it because it's something more of a trending but yeah look how beautiful these shoes are these are Jimmy Choo and they have about the front there's a pointy you know I let my point so I'm going to try these on and show you what they look like these are the Jimmy twoshoes that's so cute and pretty I love them I love the bow sometimes I find the heel on the Jimmy Choo a bit too low for me but this is quite a nice heel you can probably have they're so cute so cute the next thing I wanted to try I say trial I get some sort of beauty product but it's not so if deep panting annoying you he's so thoughtful baby anyway I just thought difficult they're kind of not very me at all but kinda have some from Valentino I wear every single winter America tiny bit too small to me so anytime anyone's like what a walk yeah sure and by the end of my crippled and like my toes about some bleed off I'm gonna try them on and even tell me what you think I feel like they might just be a bit too cool to me but I kind of like them and I like kind of making girly dresses as you guys know I love to wear like masculist quite happy okay obviously I would have wear them in this dress but what do you guys think if you're like The BFG when I wear them because they're just so heavy that I need to like use my leg like this I don't think they make my legs that weird because they're just so big and clunky what I'm something now it's either going to go up today or tomorrow so I still want to mean my mind of balance and please let me know in the comments what you thought I'll show you a closer I kind of love that but my mom does good so well she says they like ski boots so you do feel like that kind of like heavy Elena but it still kind of lot better let me know what you think next thing I wanted to show you in this call is this dress which I saw from Diane Von Furstenburg have once dinner like this from hmm same kind of stripes more of a winter dress I loved it so much I wore all the time so easy to wear and super flattering and gorgeous and I was like this is like a summer version it's light and since I'm going to try to start and show you what it is like but I want to show you almost like this which is a straw bag I posted a picture and then two gram stories of all my straw bags being my how many straw bags is too many for just oh my gosh so cute and this bit is like a tact I got one from but for you people I think it wasn't it was just a bit too big and the little lid wasn't attached and that kind of bug throw up led to this one down below oh my god so what do you guys think of this dress I love the colors on first glance I honestly prefer the hmm fit to this fit although I do really like the color it does come with a little slip underneath oh and here are the shoes it would definitely pair these two together I think it'd look really nice I don't know I think the fit is a little bit baggy here on me but I do really like the color of it this is a skirt I'd be much more inclined to keep it I think if you're taller this would look so good on you I'm 51 so I think it's just a bit short but I have two things to show you a top and a skirt I wouldn't wear them together but I just want to just show you them at the same happy this top is from a CV a white solid house nothing new here but I just really like the sleeves I thought the sleeves are really unique and the fabric is really beautiful as well and then the second thing I have to show you is this wraparound skirt which has a soak this slip it loves the blue and the cream together and I think with heels and a little crop top it will look really sweet no I love white after all the tops but I don't actually have a white off shoulder top it in craft until now there's top of the trigger on the hunt for so long I'm going to keep selling out so I still get back in stock now if it is I'll think it's a little but what I really liked about this one is it at hand it'll turn you know how you describe these can someone tell me I call them like baubles and I like but it's not just straight across it's a little bit more flattering and feminine and then you have stood a lot of ribbons which I haven't tied I'm wearing highwaisted pants right now which is probably why it looks a bit weird but you were wearing jeans that's where my jeans would normally sit and then I actually wanted to show you Pam which I can't decide about I think we get cocked up they can look really sweetheart so we're going to see through not sure if you guys can see that a little bit seethrough so you're going to get them get some nude underwear as well I don't like that you can see the pocket in the pants but I do really like the little pompoms at the bottom I had a black pair of these kind of count from winter and I wore them for all the times I wanted like a white pair for summer but I don't know about the Petersons or the pocket thing this is the last thing I have to show you and I can't return it because I've worn it already but I love it so much returned it from urban outfitters its most amazing red emoji salsa breath look at the hemline I'm wearing it with the Jimmy Choo shoes again just to show you what it looks like but look at this oh my gosh it's just so beautiful I've already told like ten friends to go and buy it they love it so much I want to show you what I acted like after I basically had like a bit of a makeup party so I have no foundation on this side by the way the glam glow totally got rid of my spot it was amazing overnight by the way and I probably tried on about four different kind lipsticks just to swatch because then you from NARS and I wanted to see what the colors of life and I also tried new nails foundation on my skin I put it on half my face and not this half and it's actually to pay off for me I don't know if you can see that on camera but I wait you like for me though any too much my face and get into bed so I'm going to end this vlog I'm really happy that my spot just a bit literally overnight the glam glow mask is so good it's the thirsty mud by the way the blue one I'm a big fan I am littering umber one fan of hydrating your spots rather than scrapping them and using like spa creams and stuff like that anyway wash my acne video if you haven't seen that already okay I'm going to go now and wash my face and let's take this hair mask out of my hair I've had a fun evening that's not so you guys it ain't good night everybody thank you for watching see you next week"	3642

lot of collapse I guess coming up and sponsorships and I'm getting really overwhelmed so I needed a vlog to vent a little bit but my ankles are cranky when I walk but it's just a lot because I never do consistent sponsorships but it's just all of the brands that I want to work with that want to work with me to have the same timeline so it's a little overwhelming I just did my makeup a little tiny bit just so when I'm foaming and stuff I look Sam I put together I have to do this voiceover right now for a video 7 so here I also have so much to do that I need to write it down on a piece of paper because I ordered new planners today from Anthropologie I found a random planner even though I order two today but I found a really random one lying around then I don't even like that might just not that fun but I needed something in the meantime to plan up these videos because I have one for Neutrogena one for Sephora one for Sephora collection cuz I'm the ambassador of Sephora collection or one of them and then I also have a Lulu's video because I have been partnered with them for a really long time and we have a year partnership along with Sephora collection and then Eugenia and Sephora are just onetime partnerships as of right now even though and like potentially I'd love to work with those brands longterm but that opportunity hasn't presented itself yet so right now I am just exporting

do you do on it really prepare for this event I kind of just decided that was going today so this little red dress I got off princess Polly it's from I am Gia boots our docks and then this is a Prada other jacket and as you can tell I don't know how to do hair so oh you guys you're gonna die it's amazing just got back nice I'm logging just got home you know what that's good for the most part I mean I saw it like I really gotta get in and clean all of it out for real for real but until then that's gonna have to do I'm gonna wash my makeup off and then come the drama's on and I'll see you in a second okay wait pause I actually thought it would be hopeful to show you what I've been using a breakdown my makeup so I either use this amazing micellar water oh it's on the floor I'm so stupid I've been really liking this I'm gonna be doing an updated skincare routine now I'm gonna be doing a get on ready with me really soon drugstore makeup or a drugstore skincare Edition but this is one of the products I really like and it's this micellar cleansing water and I usually do this first to take off my makeup or I use this oil it depends what I'm in the mood for since I have a little bit of heavier makeup on I'm gonna use this I just put this on my face dry and then it rinse it off after if it wants to focus that would be really cool but it doesn't you good morning everyone it obviously is the next morning um I have a little bit too today I need to pick out some outfits off of Lulu I'm obviously not gonna show you because I want to wait till the actual video where are my slippers I can't remember I'm saying anyway I'm gonna upload my school outfits video it's 9:20 right now I woke up like 10 minutes ago and I'm hoping to have a productive day I'm gonna sign up for a

12:30 I finish my clothing haul filming part and I finished the whole trial and portion of the video as well so I'm really proud of that I don't have time to fill my Neutrogena video right now this is usually when you work with a brand they have things that would like you to mention about the product just so people are educated about it and stuff like that I really don't want to rush to try and film that video because I just wanted to be really good I wanted to be really good quality and I have like ten minutes before I need to leave my house so I'm gonna wash my face I'm actually gonna use this to take off my makeup this is what I'll be using in my drugstore video anyway but it's really good because I'm gonna tell the story in that video how I started you great I'm gonna tell the story in that video how I started using this product but it does take off basically all my makeup so I'm just gonna use that really quickly okay now that my makeup is off I forgot how well that stuff worked

"no_A HOME DAY VLOG  Lily Pebbles.txt"	"morning everyone I am in gym clothes and my hair is tied up it's last day greasy hair but my PT texts me yesterday she was like we're really in this book in a session because I've been away and once I stopped doing it for a while its reading I'd like to get back into it so I've seen her today later on so I thought I would just wear gym clothes all day I'm not really gonna put on much makeup I'm just putting on like a really small amount so that I don't feel kind of gross all days mainly just for me because I feel like when I'm wearing a bit of makeup I feel a bit more me this is just the Estee Lauder CC cream which isn't really anything it just gives me a bit of like color and a bit of glow and it's like perfect for no makeup days anyway I hope you've all been really well I do have a vlog from New York coming up next Wednesday so my vlogs are a little bit out border for a little while New York was really really nice I've also got a video on Sunday coming up and me and Anna filmed whilst we were there so that would be really good this by the way is the Laura Mercier secret concealer for under eyes I got sent us recently and I quite like it I've been a bit all over the place recently because I went to Stockholm came back for like a weekend and rich wasn't here that weekend and then I went straight off to New York it's been really fun but I feel like I've been a bit like all over the place and I'm just going through a funny time it's hard to explain it but I'm just feeling a little bit funny and negative at the moment and when I am feeling like that certain parts of my job start to frustrate me more than they would usually but I am working through it it's just quite a busy month I'm gonna use the glossier concealer because it's very sheer I feel like I haven't done much vlogging recently unless it's been a travel vlog and there's been a few occasions where I've started vlogging at home and then end up kind of scrapping the vlog because only she wasn't doing anything most days at the moment when I'm not traveling I'm literally just sitting at my desk not doing anything so it's quite hard to vlog but hopefully today's vlog will come out ok I hope you guys are enjoying my Instagram's from New York I took my Fuji film XT to camera with me which most of my Instagram photos at the moment I've been taking them on that camera and I really really like it I would definitely recommend it especially over the what's the other camera there like all the bloggers use Olympus ten it's like a hundred times better but I think it's also a lot more expensive it's like the same price as a proper proper camera but yeah I really like it it's so great but WiFi as well so it's perfect for Instagram photos because I can just take a load of photos and then when we sit down have lunch or something I can just WiFi them over to my phone and edit them on there this is the Loreal cushion bronzer so yeah I've been enjoying putting up some photos from New York because I was a bit quiet honest to go before again just because I felt like I had nothing to post because I've been doing much other than sitting at my desk and working do you feel like a little bit of pressure to be like super positive in my videos and online on Twitter and stuff I know that usually I'm a bit of a kind of cynical sarcastic mone person but at the moment it's not that I'm creating cynical sarcastic emoni I'm like genuinely feeling like quite sad and negative and I'm not entirely sure why so it's really difficult cuz I feel like a massive pressure to hide that and come across as really positive and I think a lot of you guys have commented on my video saying like you seem really sad recently and I feel bad cuz I know no one wants to hear someone be sad and monie and negative so I'm trying to be as kind of positive as I can when I'm feeling a bit crappy when we were in New York Anna and I we went to Sephora because we were there on the day that Fenty Beauty launched venti beauty is Rihanna's new makeup range and honestly I hadn't really heard much about it beforehand so there wasn't really like a hype I wasn't I know many expectations you went to the cancer and kind of like lword our way through so it was quite busy and went to have a look and I didn't buy anything and everyone's doing Fenty Beattie videos at the moment so I thought I would quickly talk about my kind of initial thoughts and why I didn't buy anything I think the reason I didn't buy anything because I don't think it's a makeup range that is aimed at me a lot of the products are very very glittery very shimmery kind of crazy like that gold highlight everyone obsessing over I would never ever wear that it's just far too intense for me I much more kind of natural subtle makeup I'm very impressed and that she's launched with foundations and so many shades and I think that's the point of her range I think the point is that it's appealing to all different skin tones and I think it's incredible and the way you shop the foundation and pick your color is brilliant and we desperately need something like that in industry so I think it's great it's just not for me like the foundation is matte I definitely wear matte foundations I think the matchstick ideas a really cool but I just the colors were not something I would want to wear and there was just nothing that really appealed to me so I just settled on the fact that I don't think it's a product range that's aimed at me and that's okay I went to check it out and I've seen I've watched all the videos of people uploading reviewing it and it it looks like it works really well for a lot of people the foundation actually looks really Chloe on some people so I'm kind of tempted to try that but I just didn't feel like I needed it I've got so much makeup so that's why I didn't pick anything up in New York this is a keycode cream blusher I ordered a couple of jumpers on a sauce yesterday I'm filming a video this Friday with a brand which is like an autumn style video and honestly I haven't really like sorted out my autumn wardrobe yet it just hasn't been top priority for me I'm also going away at the end of the month and before mine and Rich's wedding anniversary so I know can you believe it's nearly been a year since we got married I literally can't believe that I don't think we're doing presents because we're both going to Italy together which hope you'd be really nice like relaxing I'm gonna try I've got work to do but I'm going to try not to kind of do it instagrams and stuff anyway so I'm going to Italy's I feel like someone's not completely over and I haven't really like sorted through my wardrobe and put all my cell clothes away and injected any kind of autumn clothes I haven't really had time to do like a proper clothes shop I also need to dig out all my autumn clothes from last year and see if there's and any jumpers and stuff that I want to wear again this year because I'm sure there will be so anyway I only did a couple of jumpers from ASOS because I need to wear like an autumnal outfit on Friday when I found this video so hopefully one of those will look good fingers crossed I think I'm gonna make myself some poor which was the time 8:30 I need to go get some cash out for my PT II also need to go to next to you buy an outfit because I'm doing this kind of like blogger panel thing at the end of the month and they want me to wear all of next clothes obviously they said they could send it to me but I am really bad at shopping online and sometimes I just like to lift clothes to try them on in real life so I'm gonna go to the next shop and try on an outfit and then I'd quite like to pop into home cents it's definitely not something I need to do but everyone's be going that recently and a few other bloggers have been doing some paid work with them and I saw I think on Susie's channel but they have pink fluffy cushions and I am really up some pink fluffy cushions especially if they're like more affordable than some of the other really expensive ones so kind of want to go over look there it next the next anyway so I can kind of pop in and then I need to go to my mom's house because I just pick up some products that are there then I'm gonna have my PT 130 I think one o'clock and then I'm gonna work for the whole of the afternoon and evening let's make some breakfast okay I'm gonna go out and get all my stuff done first because I always I feel like I can't be fully productive I like no I'm going out so I'm gonna go to next and home scents and get money out and go to my mom's on the way back and try and be quick about everything I just remembered I had a really weird dream last night I can't really remember you know and you can't quite remember a dream but I know that there were snakes involved and it was really horrible I also woke up and had a rant on Instagram because every day I have to read comments from some of you guys not everyone I know asking me or telling me that they think I'm pregnant and seriously guys please stop I'm not pregnant I'm not trying to be pregnant but if I was it's still none of anyone's business and some people really struggle to get pregnant you never know what someone's going through it's really rude to ask if someone's pregnant it's rude to say that they are looking puffy in the face or they're looking glowy or that they literally look pregnant because you should just always think whether you would say something someone's face or not and if you wouldn't and don't say it in a comment online I know that most of the time it's someone young who doesn't understand or it's someone who maybe English isn't their first language and they don't mean for it to sound like that but if you think of it from my point of view in getting these comments every day is like hundreds of comments asking if I'm pregnant it is absolutely draining and it's killing me slowly so please please don't ask me if I'm pregnant or if I'm trying to be pregnant or anything today's pregnant please I'm still in love with my raybans that I got in Stockholm Anna takes the piss out of me because she's like it won't be long until you want some new sunglasses but I've never felt this way about sunglasses I swear I love them and they are perfect there was a key what I wanted it's actually quite sunny today but it's freezing oh my god it's like proper autumn autumn is here oh this jumper was from ASOS like a year ago people always ask me when I wear it but it's like super cozy a car believe how cold it is I need to go buy some autumn clothes at some point maybe this weekend oh okay think we're gonna do next bluesy next first turn the car on I feel like this thing is gonna flip up into you so I feel like I've got on my Moaning out now in this vlog and I'm gonna try making the rest of the vlog a bit more cheery someone just like to be really weirdly cuz I was vlogging I mean next but I'm just trying on lots of different things jackets dresses skirts and some jeans okay I might quickly pop to home sense but that took a lot longer than it was supposed to kind of find him outfit and stuff so it's on that also I told my friend Gemma I'd pick up some stuff for her she had a baby boy very very sweet um but she needed some baby girls and stuff so I was trying to find all the different sizes and everything I did that got her baby girls got myself an outfit and now I'm gonna pop you to HomeSense remember when I said it was cold take that back it's like the hottest day ever and I'm wearing a huge hoodie Sun has come okay I found HomeSense let's go see if they have these people flossing dishes I'm gonna try and not get distracted found a gray fluffy one but no pink one yet I found this one which I really like but I'm not sure I feel like everything in my flat is it was too blue and green already hmm I think I might leave it for now okay so I didn't get anything from home since in the end I really didn't need anything sometimes I feel like I just need to like itch that craving but actually I realized when I was in there I just don't need I don't need it so I've just gone to my parents house because I need to pick something up from my old bedroom where I keep a lot of the stuff that I can't put it in my flat lucky parents do you guys remember this old bedroom Jeremy this wall I used to film in front of I like painted it blue so I could have a different background and then my bed which actually has two mattresses on it because this is mine which is old mattress before we got a symbol one we didn't want to throw it away so we keep it here my bedside table wallpaper my drawers funny being back in here yeah here's like all my stuff in boxes and all my suitcases because we haven't got loft in our flat write some letters okay I am home I dropped the clothes at Gemma's I went to my mom's to pick up the stuff you saw that picked up some sushi on the way which I put in the fridge and now I've got my PT session it tries to make it one so it would be like in my lunch break but everything this morning is taking ages so I haven't really got to my desk yet today Wow fruit flies it's so hard to get rid of I know you have to put like a glass the sugar water or something I'm gonna give my PT session in the park I'm not gonna film it because I haven't seen it for a couple of weeks so I'm going to be really rubbish and I need to just like concentrate and it's quite nice to have a bit of no camera time as well so I will see you when I'm back and probably very achy I just got back from my workout in Park oh it's a lip balm on my lips are so sore today and when they haven't got lip balm on oh my god they're burning can you see how sore they are I don't think my lips will ever go back to normal this is still from a lipstick I wore on my wedding day last year they've never been the same since sometimes they're okay and then look they've just turned into the sort of lips that are very sensitive like I've just been out on the cold and they're so so anyway the workout was good I'm just gonna have some sushi I bought spicy tuna rolls funny cuz I feel like my PT also happens to be one of my best friends are the best friends it's like having a therapist I feel like today we had a very gentle session because she knows I haven't been well and I'm not feeling so great in mentally and physically fish took it easy on me and we just talked about a lot of stuff and it's quite nice really because also she's so like detached from everything that I can talk quite openly and honestly and she lets me just a moment to her which is great feel bit sorry for her but yeah it's just good to get the fresh air I've had a lot of them well not a lot I've had a few comments about why I don't really vlog with my friends much anymore which I hadn't really noticed but it was totally right I don't I used to do laughs a lot of weekend vlogs with my friends I don't read tend to vlog that much on the weekend anymore I just think like as we all grow up it's quite a natural thing to show people less in my videos they're more focused just on me now which puts a bit more pressure on me but I just think like my friends are having babies and stuff and growing up and it doesn't feel right to kind of shove a camera in their face all the time one because I think they're quite private and also when I'm with my friends I tend to not be filming that I treat it more as like quality time with my friends so that's probably why not really on purpose it's just something that's naturally happened anyway I'm going to spend the afternoon working in my office need to wash my hair at some point tonight I think I'm gonna just work here on the table in my kind of living room slash kitchen because I'm not feeding my office at the moment it feels like a really negative dark scary place I don't want to go into don't know why I don't know much these days I'm gonna work here and see how I get home I've got a cup of tea eeeek I've got a glass of water I'm also gonna light a candle this is the white company wild rhubarb candle I just opened it up and then thought didn't I get sent this because I don't really remember being sent this and I'm slightly panicking that rich may have like bought this as a present for someone and just left it on the table worst comes to worst I just buy him a new one like I don't know why he would buy a candle well it smells amazing it's got plum blossom freesia freesia and apple really really nice it's very like autumnal candle hmm my Asus parcel just came yay my DPD delivery guy is so nice I know Anna and Zoe and Brighton have they like love their guy was his name like Paul or Dave hmm I can't remember they always talk about him and want to brighten stalks by the DPD delivery guy pony's very goodlooking my woods in mine is particularly goodlooking but he is such a nice guy and he's always so happy and I really think he's actually brightened up my afternoon anyway my Asus class is here I'm not gonna try on things yet because clearly I haven't showered since working out I'm a bit sweaty so let me open up and show you guys what I got one jumper from whistles it's black it's got gold buttons it looks like this it's kind of high neck we will see what and then second thing is from weekday oh this is very soft I'm glad about that this is from weekday and it's a little kind of mint drop shoulder jumper so I'm gonna try these on decide which one to keep hopefully not both that is for video I'm filming on Friday right back to my work I've just had a shower and washed my hair is like 6:30 oh my god rich said he's gonna be back late from work so I'm just taking my time and I'm just watching the Apple livestream you know Apple do like conferences I think this is an annual one I'm pretty sure it's an annual one I'm such an apple geek so I love hearing about the products they're releasing and stuff but it's so funny it's so cheesy the guys like so now we're gonna talk about and it's like a massive pause the Apple watch and then ever the audience is like I mean it's intense I just want to hear about the new iPhone but it's very dramatic I'm finding it very amusing also kind of geeking out though I secretly love it but the drama is hilarious and you know once I talk to you guys because I just tried this in the shower on Sunday on Anna's channel there's gonna be a New York Hall that we both filmed while we were out there and we talked about igk we bought a lot of stuff my GK which is a haircare brand in Sephora spoiler alert I bought the cleansing walnut' scalp scrub we both did and I just gave it a go so I thought I would let you know what I think I know this is annoying because a head of the hall is a bit of a spoiler but I was very disappointed in this it's the cleansing walnut' scalp scrub and it's called Loki I love like exfoliating scalp scrub kind of thing because I get a very dry scalp and I get like flaking quite a lot so I thought I'd give this a go girl in the picture has very nice like beachy hair which made me want to try it anyway it's like a serious scrub it literally looks like a body scrub that you would use like a brown very gritty scrub so I was like massaging it into the my scalp and it just felt like I was cut putting sand in my hair I found it really hard to wash it out oh this is very difficult to use it does kind of lather up when you add water but I felt like I was making my hair a bit dirty I have a feeling that Anna's gonna like this because I reckon the kind of grit will add volume to the hair which is just not something I want so will it really impress her that I don't think I would use it again I'm gonna probably give it away I've used the evader purifying scalp cleanser before this is the one I usually use and I'm much prefer it it's just it's like a shampoo it feels like a shampoo but it purifies your scalp and gives it good cleanse and it's much easier to use than I can actual gritty scrub I thought that was a bit of a weird thing maybe it's just my hair because it's quite hard to wash I love the packaging but yeah I just thought I'd let you know not majorly impressed with that is he still talking about the watch today it's the most used heartrate monitor in the world when they're talking about the iPhone ok I've moved the laptop up here so I can watch it whilst cooking I can't believe I'm saying this because we actually haven't made this for like over a month but I feel like whenever I'm vlogging I'm making this the Madeline Shaw coconut spiced porn Calma I know rich likes it so I'm gonna oh man I've just realized that I have no idea how to use the rice cooker and rich is gonna be out I think I'm just gonna have to figure out be a big girl I'm gonna make this with rice put all the ingredients out and I'm gonna watch this whilst I'm doing it and I'm gonna let my hair dry naturally it's just gonna get bigger and bigger and puffy and puffier as I cook we're talking about the iPhone now and the camera I've started I think I did like the onion and the cumin seeds and that's kind of just going there I've got the rice going in the rice cooker figured out how to use it it's really not that difficult we have like one thing of rice that we rinse in a sip verse and then two cups of water and it goes on 20 minutes it makes perfect rice I literally hate cooking rice in a pot sorry this guy is really annoying in the background but I want to hear what you say they just announced the iPhone X it's all very exciting and which isn't home yet so his dinners like over there keeping it warm this is the curry I know it's a huge portion but it smells and tastes delicious okay Apple event is done hair is still wet it's that's really where actually I need to like run my hands through and stuff it's been tied up while I've been cooking but underwhelmed that chalet I remember when the iPhone 7 launched I was so excited about the new camera whereas there aren't many things I'm not excited about not into the kind of face ID thing the talking emojis not really interested augmented reality I guess it would be good for some like things like maps and stuff I'm not interested in the gaming really like the charging maps but that's about it not like oh my god I need to get my hands on it straight away but as always with Apple you kind of have to update your products otherwise just things get out of date and they'll probably change the charges and stuff and I always say like I'm not into it and then it comes out and I want it my lips have gone so again okay anyway rich has just found me coming back from work now I've totally finished it no but he'll he hears when he gets back I'm gonna import all this footage now and God and edit this vlog so I hope you guys have enjoyed today's video it's just been like a homie vlog I've got a really fun video coming Sunday and I think you guys are really gonna like it and yeah I think that's it for now so thanks for watching I'll see you guys in my next video bye"	4935
"no_A Lovely Zoe Visit"	"good morning to you or afternoon if you're watching me afternoon hello it is Monday the 22nd of May and I'm feeling very calm and then I'm fresh out the shower I feel nice of what they make prompt and moisturize I feel good I didn't upload a vlog last week I was going to say I didn't film last week I actually did film all the way until listen to it Wednesday night and I'm sad and use that footage which is another quite good especially I did a shoot for children in need I did lots of shout up for children ease so I want to do that now as the children need an amazing cause well potentially put a little bit of footage here it's Thursday and I want to shoot today with Charlotte who's had to stand in as Frankie for this episode probably she had do your line line in episode you might be for you as your children age which is most wonderful children's charity and which you should definitely be involved with you'll see more of this throughout the year but the best thing about this whole shoot apart from like the people and the amazing makeup is the food I heard yes and now we're back to present day well my present day but your past vlogs are weird time machines and time is wiggly habits that phrase go from got to Oh anyway um I'll eventually get what to why I just stopped just blogging last week and I've got some family stuff going on in the background that is taking up almost all of my energy at the moment and it's nothing that I'm going to really go into here but it's just kind of will take you all of my energy and then making flogging much much more harder than usual so you'll just have to forgive me and I'm sorry but hopefully this week could be a lot better I'm committed to it I'm going to do it get it edited I've got a family waiting on FAFSA which I'm so excited about they're going to edit this on Friday night and upload it for Sunday morning so we should be all all go and already and I've got a good week this week lots of fun stuff going on so it's loads of cool stuff to film for you this morning as the doing housework which sounds really boring but I've been really slack on everything for weeks so it felt really good it's quite late that's like half 11: it felt really good just like blitzing and get some stuff done I'm feeling empowered again I'm feeling like I'm on top of my shit so to speak kind of gross actually but now I'm going to have an old squash and stitches here but not only am sticky gym shorts and have that as well beautiful for you and send out some invites because I'm on the front cover of blogosphere induce oh how cool is that and so I'm having a big launch party and I'm going to send up the inflight for it's morning there we go doing a little live show and you're all saying hi just sir I'm the slowest inviter two events ever because every time I start texting someone to invite them and it's just like having a small chat with them so so far inflected simian Alfie they can't come davon Tina Niki and Sammy my friend Vicky Dodie and Carrie hope Fletcher and I've been doing it for like an hour on a plus side I'm about to have some sweet potatoes with the greatest and vegetable time Philadelphia colleton herb hi it's sassy and we're going to wait tray we're going to make dad mum is really nice I think oh thank you oh okay are you excited chatter now what were chopped chocolate so now we're going to go stop it and so what roles are you can feel and what they've got what's our company wala cute yeah it's about no charge our price again supposed to be nine and now we are going up with a pencil school come over and this is their puppy Dottie how old is Duffy Q I'm seeing episode how are you should get them together for like a little dog playdate hi I'm more interested in the dogs would yell here I've got powerful of puppies and children among taking that out there put this in your quiet spirit so they've got how a film not calling for garden to me costumes in the back garden and hot from alcohol tickles how I bought strawberry right now I'm lifting up the loop time to stop logging anywhere like how do you know what the balance is doing blogging slugging it's like when you listen closely to actually go broke me I would say I guess Castle it's lovely someone hot a joy to hear that sound listen Oh anything little children nothing we've got snacks we've got puppies we've got doodles what money a lolly we got friends and everything hammock deep doodoo did it did it your name is Brian Brian yeah nobody's in then can I keep him no oh I'll pop you a cat is that sick cats oh yeah right lovely I've introduced off the two blue Peter did you enjoy it you do what something gone wrong with my face very red and one of the rights that doing you what did you like about it yeah it was interesting was that would you like to watch more of them yes I wonder what your failure good like care exacting a lovely oh that's nice sure delicious Liam cooked us a lovely dinner this is genuinely how I looked ten o'clock I've been play fighting with Liam and level of product in my hair budget washout tomorrow so the news the glamorous life of a number one bestselling author UN ambassador one of the things cool about me a successful youtuber and mother extraordinaire mmm 7:00 a.m. and the morning started with a pillow fight between Darcy and me Oh Debbie won the game of pillow buckaroo the scents or things we do at 7:00 a.m. yes oh right come on skipper lovely Oh get ready the drop toffee at school this morning and then when I got back in the car radio on and there had been a terrorist attack and encouraged afternoon just because it still tries to be like around her things and it's um the content area Rhonda concert in Manchester Arena and alone an attacker had detonated um a selfmade bomb this is all what her knees and and currently it's that ten o'clock now I think there were 22 people died and 59 injured and you think about the people that or at those concerts and it's like mums and daughters and the girls that I have met at so many like meet and greets and just like of all all attacks a horrific there's no like there's no way you can get around that but this one just seems to really struck me because like the these are the people that I am with all the time and in not too many years I'll be taking Darcy to concerts and right now it sort of gives me on ice and pantomimes and things but it's not long before that turns into pop concerts and gigs and haja notice I want to go and pick Darcy up from school and wrap her in a duvet and keep her in a duvet for the rest of her life and just live me and her and just go to like the park in the icecream and come home and and fish fingers and stay in the garden and that's it and I you can't live like that obviously you have to just keep on going and so and the message of sentencing on social media are like it's not going to stop us continue going to these things we're not afraid and that's the right message but wrongly or rightly like right now it's not how I feel I feel like so shook up like those mothers well everybody is easy for me to relate to some those mothers that their children were screaming and trying to get out and I don't know just all thoughts overall for why do we put do these things like well where's the sense in it what does it achieve we don't know what nationality or religion or what cause the attacker was champion champion it was like champion not a champion but you know what I mean just them doing things like that doesn't make anybody go yes what a great idea totally agree this is stupid stupid senseless and horrible anyway I wasn't sure whether to talk about this on because not entertaining and it's not like light and happy is it and it's the opposite the very opposite of those things but this when I look back on these vlogs in years or weeks to clamp this is a big part of the week so seemed only right and I think we should just take a moment to acknowledge that that has happened alrighty on with the day good morning it is about nine ish I've just done the school run I've decided to just carry on with the vlog as normal and yesterday so it was horrific and obviously that doesn't stop being horrific just because it's one day close it's one day ago doesn't mean it's not any less horrific at all but I think that the best thing to do is to carry on going I'd like the comments to be a safe and warm and respectful place for anybody just to talk about how they're feeling yesterday I found it really good to be able to tweet constantly and DM some of you and talk to my friends and Facebook message my friends and just kind of even though we're all saying the same thing which is this is awful why would someone do this and so her those poor people I can't imagine it live all saying those same things there's something about saying over and over but I think it's quite cathartic so if you would like to use the comments of the place just just to share what's in your head and heart then do please everybody else be very sensitive to that I will just straightup block people if they are not and they'll be no probably no two ways about it so just want a comments section just for this video just to be like just share what's on your heart sort of thing and and it'd be nice if you support to each other and yadda yadda don't you tell you all this just so I'm going to get on with the day so he's coming today I'm getting my nails done Custer's down there good for happy things you are a happy thing aren't you you are a happy thing on you yes you are you're a lovely boy in scratchin scratching it is gradually telling you very warm isn't it to warm with a fur coat on five years late for my nail appointment and I forgot all my cash to actually paid curly and I had to park 400 miles away from the salon and it's really hot so I think the real question so it's on all of our minds is how she kept up with a new year's resolution point below if you know about this give the people what they want clothes I'm still doing well you know everyday pressure of quiltmaking my god I'm going to set up with the go fund me at the end of the year so like a brand new bed or something that you can do that all the way so he's just rang and says it so probably to a little grubby face with you so she's going to be here as punishment at some lottery exciter haven't seen Zoe when did I last see Zoe like facetoface not Skype face don't even know das is birthday maybe did you come to that notion oh oh oh no quick I don't know anyway it's in a while just wait for it sure women come here she comes here sure you Fisher you ha ha all right trying to want me me pure no don't say things like that about ourselves on this channel I think I don't you worry us today feel like shit okay so you'll have to take out the present oh hang on a minute hang on print I'm annoyed she's done this possible Harris why does it matter we love ourselves Michelle because basically I just didn't get her birthday presentation she leaving like friend and I'm a great one right that's right crack on welcome to some books actually as much

Ella beauty soap opera or the biscuit biscuit yeah first day one as well as the Willows one off now it's nice over been updated hmm apocalyptic oh those bloody mullet rose what is that I just don't

my hand looks a bit because it's my hands but nails and it's not a matter what is this oh sleeplessly chummy hungry or anything siblings could put your toothbrushes yeah makeup ring oh my god okay I

acceptable people get time for work we actually woke up a quarter to four which is ridiculously early for a Saturday morning but we are off to the airport which is really exciting it's meant to be a happier morning I was so excited and I found out some horrific news this morning about one of my very lovely viewers i have probably little modest about 20 people that i could name off the top of my head who tweet me comment on videos come on a blog post is so supportive and one of them was killed on her holiday and they don't wanna talk about it too much but i just found out and i basically had a soft crying I'm in complete shock it's a terrible so not quite the happiest of mornings and so we are heading to the airport we are going to South France I've been going to the South France my whole life for you spent all my school holidays they're Easter summer is like a second home to me and we actually going back to the same spot my whole life so I've never actually taken you guys with me

beautiful this beaches sees right there in a minute amazing sea is right here but because it's a hotel is also a little swimming pool there which is funny not bad or assassinate not bad for an hour and a half to get here no why the best intentions of making an outfit video even brought nice outfits with me but the Canon EOS m is not good for that is too there isn't a viewfinder I forget so I mean there isn't is only a screen so when it's sunny is weak heart to see how to focus things and i was it's really shaky without a tripod so that's a shame anything that's going to happen i prefer to spend my day relaxing and stressing about a video so today i found it some photos of outfits I can and continue vlogging think it's time some serious peace relaxation now which is gone for a swim

Essex I've only been to Essex once and I was like a few weeks ago for the tshirt competition thing with NCS we were in like a university of thing just on the outskirts or maybe actually in Essex I'm not too sure but anyway I'm heading back to Essex I'm going on a little road trip to Essex to hand out the very first obviously I I I have one but then again you know I would but I the second ever copy of this book obviously I have number one the first person to get a copy of use name regenerated after myself has been announced well if it they don't I don't think they know that I'm arriving or maybe they do I'm not too sure but I did a competition on Amazon quite a while ago where one person I've ever one who pulled my book one person was going to be the person I go and visit in person to handdeliver the very first signed copy as she wait it's the first ever signed copy because do up mine my one i don't even show you this yeah I can mine's not even signed you know cuz I mean why would

today are you mate so we're currently on the road I have no idea where bus we are we're all elector Essex South South End South Shields so South End um my job is not right in this pile the world we're playing would you rather and we've had a really rather coming through what was it and would you rather a fly permanently buzzing around your head for the rest of your life or to smell permanently a bit like cabbage oh if the tapping is tough I said I would rather long think about this nice I bring up a further fly because I just can't imagine always men and cabbage cabbage in a nice smell and I think the fly doesn't this say mean you smell which means it's just attracted to you but then we were Saints annoying that would have like do you know you've got fly buzzing or the added layer of that bloody colonies a we've been there let me know the courts below what you would do would you rather have jelly babies for nails or strawberry laces for hair the thing is is it fizzy strong relators for normal shoelaces not are seen as a gamechanger yeah I guess the fizzy ones are too thick and she would always fall out let me have to brush them and winter whereas if you had normal ones you could almost get enough of them you could have any hair store you want I can do the physical I walk with they've been changed to fizzy change now um I don't think physics that going back to the fly issue I think we're gonna go going exactly I would loss I would definitely have J baby's fingernails because you because I don't really large any babies anyway so it was I would never lick them a bite more anything I don't think and it won't grow you just a to say I think the best would you rather czar the really really boring simple ones though like I'm in a mutual the past so I kind of think that Dean would rather go see a future or the past sure yeah wouldn't everyone know what the futures like but both are really terrifying yeah I would love to invite my Egyptian times so that you will see how they lived by Roman times that you messed with the timespace continuum The effect of Columbia do you know that's better that we can't go exactly I like the ones like would you rather have like permanently squeaky shoes when you enter a room it goes like this a bit to do Emma conversation I would wonder anyway look above anything Emma we don't get to be really quiet he's so funny like honestly like it always happens I'm sorry I can't change it I'd rather much gun shy like a quiet room and your shooter clumsy squeaking this is even more embarrassing yeah there's the timid to do it

if you also enter the Amazon competition you didn't win but you might be a runnerup I think I have like a couple of hundred come from how many hundreds it was but I've got a sign here my signature on there and in here if I haven't broken it a little bit squashed now water stones have an exclusive Edition for some of their books right and you better find them in the stores I'm pretty sure on launch day and the reason why these are special are because so this is the jacket of the book so this goes around the book and as you'll see this goes on the inside of the book don't break don't break don't break so I'll see this folder on the inside of the book this side and then this side they're like a collectible cards on the inside and you can pull these out of the jacket let they come out of the jacket and then you have like four collectible cards and then on this side this is where it's interesting right on this side we have oak he's a guy I've given away the characters names in the book my last do this that early on I don't know you'll find out anyway we're very close publication de salt it lets us go for it I'll take the heat guys don't worry but here we have a shiny Evy card is kind of like a guess like a similar to let you know like your trading card games there's always one shiny now the main character the main one this is the main one this is the Charizard if well of the username Eevee cards have all the books you'll find the Waterstones they're only a hundred shiny edy cars there's a lot of normal edy cards out there there's only a hundred shiny edy cards so that's your task if you ever in a waterstones book water stone shop and you buy a copy and you find the shiny Eevee card in the tweet picture of it I want to see you tweet a picture of you with the book and also the cars I want to see you tweet me a picture of you with the book with this et card still actually not taken out but still in the book like this that's what I want to say any of you tweet me that and you'll be part of my special 100 my special regenerated 100 there we go I guess I carry this book around with me at all times memory kind of rucksack and if I meet anyone in the street I'm gonna give this to you if I'm vlogging on that day I'm gonna make sure that I've get you in the vlog giving you this I guess the second ever signed copy if using regenerated I'm not too sure but there we go right moving on sorry about in the background I've got a washing up I'm embedding its bedding it's that time of the week water for bedding um put this one here no I'm gonna let it out radiators in this house so I've got a kind of like put stuff on the clotheshorse and just hope there dries or get a tummy I do have a tumble dryer but it never properly cleans it then probably dried it you know I mean anyway today I received a parcel Oh I kind of I want this turned off okay don't go down say that by the way today is the launch of the new iPhone 7 and this arrived in a post I guess it can mean only one thing and I'm very excited I've never lost the phone in a touch what I need touchwood because I'm so paranoid Ted if you paper is wouldnít so there we go I have never lost a phone in my life and I've never broken I should have broken one phone in my life and it was a Sony Ericsson something about my mum's handmedown furniture gave to me once and but wearing tracksuit bottoms and it fell out my phone close my car door and screamed you might even get weapon it got completely obliterated but anyway I'm still having a big phone and for me it still fits my pocket all right that was my main issue again the 7 plus round the 7 was because I thought it's nothing my pockets and look weird it kind of doesn't look weird I don't think it looks that weird I thought you know for the end of this vlog I will give you a little unboxing video I'm not known with my unboxing videos in my vlogs as we know oh they just made it so appealing to open look you were thought about like the plastic around it it just comes off like so effortlessly as all the way the Box just slides off just about to do one at all I just do why you yeah they're so on it even with at packaging they've like they've gone that they put up a whole department just on packaging who work year in year out just finding the best ways to make opening an iPhone enjoyable they go but there's no iPhone Jack I have more of these than I'll ever need in my life all right sweet odd you know what I'm very happy the fact I've got a new iPhone charger as well Kaspar you still always steal my Apple chives on my last Apple charger kaname not borrowed it for an uber and he left it in the uber so finally I reunited with another proper Apple charger oh so he took it does come with an eye it does come with a jack I've lost I've lost the phone where do I put them oh here is beer basically this is it I'm gonna try and set it up I have a little get little play around with it and just see what it's like yeah is it oh my god we're still going he's still going Oh an asset it's always give me a hug joy main packaging look oh it was almost like it was give me a hug I just know what they're doing they're not the wireless ones I saw in the pictures and people calling us and fast about and they've got like the this by the charging adapter so you can just listen to music normally why they were making a fuss about the whole I headphone thing what's the fuss about just plug it in like a normal person right it's the end of the night now and these jeans right I got these jeans for my birthday really nice jeans right but they're an absolute like that is not coming off that ankle I don't care what you say that is not coming off give your heart boos are staying gross they're the hardest gene these are the hardest jeans to take off in the in the world it is our thinking all yeah oh you look what you've gotten rolled up that's why no look you'd if I unroll them right I can still roll hang on look this it is don't go with your ankle a woman was before this and it took about half an hour to forget all of them this is this stuck right it is now bedtime and you can't ever as you can't even see me what end to a vlog

AMR is about to literally kealoha hasn't eaten anything in about three days and I still feel bad because I can't do a lot because I'm watching a Jenica otherwise she'd look full down the stairs or get crushed beneath some fallen furniture I sort of feel useless like I'm slacking maybe I am we don't want to move again in a long time the worst thing about this is that we will be because we have to find a house so I'm really excited about I'm not going more into that when I've got time best thing about this whole situation I think is the fact that I can now obsessively go and write weave again that I've got an excuse rather than just so looking for no reason so makes me think the house that fell through wasn't right if I was still looking anyway so I'm maybe a blessing in disguise yeah I mean once they actually get time to happen to come right move it's gonna be amazing hi everyone so after almost a week really feeling really really unsettled um both babies they've not been a nightmare and I've just been really unsettled and going bed times have just been a nightmare Ted's been waiting every and hard two hours at night which has been so draining to the point where I've really considered given that breastfeeding just so that I don't have to do the night fees and that it's no Thursday we moved yesterday and they've both just gone to bed really easily sorry my computer keeps turning itself off and I'm trying to edit my Sunday video which is actually a little vlog about why we're moving and why with me it's Sunday I'm in my new office and I will do a little tour of my office when it's set up I sort of feel like we're starting to get things together a little bit I feel less like I'm in a panic which is really good and yeah it's just it's crazy trying to do anything with I thought having a baby although they've napped loads today but I think that's because it's just been so weird and they haven't been sleeping properly so that's been good and I've been unpacking in the bedroom I found some old jeans that I've managed to get into shoehorn my midriff into and yeah it's all good I'm feeling very positive I have to go and see one of my really good friends in fact this used to be her hats so it's nice being here even if it is sort of a short amount of time and we're going to go and have something roast right now so we're walking back being back in London again like London's only four years ago that's an interesting pattern on my face isn't it look um it's Tuesday no it's not okay that week is it Monday by the way thank you so much for everyone's comments and emails that people have sent me saying like good luck with the move and it will be fine and you know pair on through and it's really been so uplifting genuinely I did not mean to break down in the middle of that last video which I will link to if you haven't seen that it was just like a temporary piece of fluff in my eye but obviously I must have been really stressed and sort of overwhelmed so thank you I was really quite touched well very touched that so many people were concerned and took the time to sort of rally my spirits so thanks for that really I really appreciate it I'm feeling very positive positive start to a new week look at my face doodoodoodoo GG right I have to go and do some work because that's what I'm supposed to be doing that's why Ted has gone to the shops with his daddy because I was like I have to get this work done right now and Here I am lounging on the sofa are you gonna make him dizzy okay stop stop the chair stop the chair that's it give him a little cuddle ah mr. AMR is going back to London until tomorrow night so I am here on my own yeah you want to guess on no it's too small for you it's for babies it is a lot later than I thought what it was it's 5:14 means we can start getting ready for bed in about 20 minutes because babies can't read the time hasn't actually been too bad then mr. Iman was with his sheep at 10: tomorrow morning so you should be done quite quickly he's shooting Gordon Ramsay fun for him not so much fun for me because I'm gonna be going stircrazy by then I would go out and I think I will try to conquer my fear on this one and go down basically at the front of the house with a set of stone steps so there's the front door and then pausing you mrs. boffin Bert don't don't land on him and be careful on the swingy season yeah and I haven't I just can't work out how I will get a toddler down there and then there's a busy road and then a baby and then get them into a double / a double I think I'm gonna have to leave a sort of array of holding pens at the top and then but then I don't want to go down the stairs leave one it's like that and puzzle when is the Fox you don't want to eat the rabbit or whatever it is but I feel like we should get out so maybe that's what we'll do oh look the best of friends always cuddling going to bed I just want to point out that my children are only ever sick when I'm alone so that's fun Ted's just been projectile vomiting and has soaked the duvet and the mattress aim vom so I'm gonna sleep on the spare bed because I don't have any washing powder to do any washing and it's really late so yeah tomorrow last day of my week in the life of let's see what it brings I try and do something exciting but I've got Tesco delivery at 12 so I don't know how much I'm gonna get done to be truthful but we'll see I've bought the most random selection of books with me I don't know whether I mentioned this but all of our books have gone into storage and just because we thought there was no point carting them about with us however I forgot about the books that were in Angelica's room sort of an overflow from the shelving system and so a lot as I said come with us once I talk you through it's quite an eclectic mix of things so I've got loads of actual you know good books I want to get my teeth into I've also got all of my baby books this actually might be a good chance to read those babies first skills brain rules which was from my mum your baby weekbyweek haven't looked at that once poor second baby is a and then up here in another mixture of various books ones I haven't read all now I packed all of my cookbooks I don't know whether I've mentioned that so I've got kiddies healthy appetite there and I'm looking forward to reading that and really need some healthy eating ideas or just not help me just homecooked you know loads more loads that I've read already didn't like this David Nicholls book I read that eight escaped but anyway that's byebye want to get started on this but so many people have said that it's really upsetting really intense and a bit depressing so I'm sort of worried about getting cracking on that then we've got the Annie Pru bark skins which I did try to read but it was just I found it really heavy going the unknowns among diary which I started was brilliant and I want to finish a few other things so they're my random book selection and then over on the other side her brain we have Angelica's library she's got loads look nice old mix of things there and whoosh juice we've been shopping prepping for a video that I might shoot on Friday but it's been really nice to the Anton house and in bath such nice shops which pleases me obviously and my friend rates has been showing me around because she's born and bred in bath and knows it inside out which is amazing and now we're going home and I think I might stop on a high note it's been a week but good so joints say goodbye we'll see everybody next time has a see you next time see you next time everyone hi"	2423

"no_A Weekend in Scotland"	"good morning guys we have just woken up in the beautiful admire bay house which is in ullapool about an hour and a half north of Inverness that was the worst Scottish accent I think I've ever done in my life and we would you'll know if you watched last week's vlog because I kind of blocked the journey at the end of it but yeah just woken up to this most incredible view and have the best night's sleep because there was absolutely no noise no lights anywhere just so so so peaceful and I think we're gonna do a little bit of exploring this morning just made myself a cup of tea the gang are all getting ready downstairs the boys are off mountaineering climbing one of the hills so yeah it should be a nice relaxing weekend and this place it was staying this is so beautiful it's just lovely I'm I think it's a full bedroom cottage got our personalized dressing yawns we're gonna make some breakfast now so catch up with you later so we essentially drove all the way up here to go to the beach but also because we saw on Instagram that there was a camera that did really lovely hot chocolate and we've come and sadly the cafe is closed because of it it's obviously isn't but it comes like a little village and found some little fried shacks a little bit around hairdresser here once again your highlights done we have made it home now from our three hour long trip every hour round trip I think I updated you that we basically went all that way to find this very Instagram full hot chocolate and it was closed but we all got some nice marks so that might be M so the journey was not wasted we know about her to Casa handles just popping some champagne or training find a nice trade to put the champagne on but we can't so I'm gonna go get the act without Laila I left outside okay so we're gonna go in the tub we're gonna have some bubbly and the boys have just gone off to watch the rugby its England vs Scotland so hopefully do I get stoned if you think

kitchen we're all kind shipping in everything about shafts not chicken to using a chicken really chasing good light now shoes Hey oops team that lands bag good morning it is day two in Scotland and standing I finish the vlog in copy last night because we basically just have some heaters and then started playing card games humanity which probably is not the best thing to vlog and this morning we just left the cottage the other nice Sunday back first thing cakes eggs bread and now we're just exploring the local beaches near the cottage so the surroundings are pretty spectacular and yeah can you go for nice in the walk being a proper bit of exploring this morning we've just climbed down this rock wall from the from the cottage we've made it's pretty much sea level Tanner is currently over there vlogging from a cave and I'm just chilling right sea is just such a beautiful clear color Terrenas hey guys so I'm back home now I didn't really finish vlogging properly and Scotland cuz my memory card was just playing up so much and it's Wednesday now I didn't vlog yesterday because I was just in town loads of meetings and I feel like you guys have seen far too many days of me going into town having meetings today is day two of a really really bad hair day I just can't seem to do anything with my hair so I'm just scraping it back and yeah I'm gonna look like a bald man for the rest of the day but never mind so it's half ate at the moment I've already had a call so it's been quite a busy morning and I've got loads of blog posts scheduled last night so feeling it good about blogging life um now I'm going for a meeting with Bobby Brown really close to where I live actually so we're just going to go to the Breakfast Club so I thought I'd take you down with me and then I'm going to biscuit ears also close to where I live on North Korea and we are going to have a little biscuit icing masterclass they're really exciting bits and bobs for today so let's go so in fact home now after a very busy day I'm sitting on the floor because I'm trying to stop Dexter from shredding everything that is underneath the bed biscuit ears is really good fun I learned so much about icing and became a bit of a pro at icing Valentines biscuits so I'm probably gonna give Charlie some of those on Valentine's Day then I went into town had a few meetings which I didn't vlog because I feel like you've seen me going to meetings about a million times in vlogs I did come back fire bobs scrap that so I ended up I'm doing it all and actually I just did a snapchat story of opening it up and first impressions so make sure you're following me on snapchat if you want to see kind of like opening of the blogger mail because yeah I tend to snapchat it quite a lot and it's nice to share my first impressions with you I'm so shiny I think I'm gonna go downstairs now I'm not gonna lie that it's actually knocking me out though so much stuff um so I'm gonna go downstairs and cook myself a macaroni cheese what is my hair doing I have one of those days and I'm like my skin is bad my hair is bad everything is just not going my way so yeah I'm gonna go make myself a macaroni cheese so vlogging yesterday went really well obviously not I can't even remember what I filmed I think I showed you my macaroni cheese and then probably went into the food coma so it is Thursday yes it's Thursday today and I'm still having a bad hair day so I've just tied it up and Platt feeling a bit like Lara Croft in my leather look jeans Karen Millen love them um and highneck don't know why I do this when I'm wearing a Platt anyway I've got a blowdry at 11:00 so all is not lost I will have lovely hair again soon I'm sure um but yeah it's about quarter past 8: in the morning now I've just done a first impressions of all of my new makeup on my snapchat so if you're interested in what I think of makeup when I tried out for the first time then definitely do follow me on snapchat because I do first impressions at least once a week like I'll have a good session of opening vlog a male and then I will put it all on my face and let you know how I feel about it on snapchat and so yeah my makeups a little bit different to usual because that's trying out loads different things I can see from the screen that I need to apply some powder I always forget to put on powder because my skin feels dry um like it feels dry on my face but it obviously looks shiny ramble aside um Dexter has got something wrong with his eye he's it's as though like it's been star or something always got something in it because like one of his eyes is really puffy and I can just tell from his behavior that he's not a happy bunny so I don't leave him at home today I'm going to take him to my meetings with me so I've just emailed a few of the people that I'm meeting asking if we can change places because sadly not everywhere is dog friendly I might be like a dog friendly guide to London because I tried to find one another was uptodate or actually nice places so yeah might take him with me more often and do a little writeup of places that actually accept doggies because it might be helpful for any other dog owners so as I said quarter past eight which means first time I get on the chew but we half past eight which means megamega rush hour so yeah I'm going to attempt to take a dog on the Victoria Line at rush hour wish me luck so we survived the commutes this little one was getting lots of love and attention from all the you fellow commuters I'm now at four German German gymnasium and they've just been discussing lovely new Tom Ford launches for the new spring/summer collection which I'll show you having at home and now we're gonna go down on time staged car shopping because somebody is rather lastminute so I now come to the Ilario Bateman tree and then launching or they've just norwich tanu range of products with plate which I have never heard of before I think they're probably the first to market doing play in the hair products so this mask was really good for oily roots and dry hands which is exactly what I have with my hats I've just had that put in as pre shampoo treatment and Dexter was sitting on my lap while I was getting my hair washed so yeah he was like yes the tops wonderful especially all the products this is the shampoo marry clay and then they've also got a dry shampoo which I haven't tried to assets looking forwards giving a girl and blue conditioner so those four and I'm going to clean lies about the full range so which I'm not at home and reporting back to you Dexter hasn't left my side at all time so lunch time filming obviously didn't happen I've just got home that noises the kettle boiling I'm just gonna you can hear me yes I'll pick up my camera at lunch time because I just sat down at home Peto and with Millie if he is PR for THD and we just were talking and talking and talking and yeah I didn't really pick up the

"no_A Weekend in Sicily - Outfit Diaries  Fashion Mumblr Travel Vlog.txt"	"Sicily so I'm here with our lovely friends Sophie and Matt we are staying at Villa Nadia which is here beautiful Villa is very kind of typical Sicilian not that I really know what typically is like I imagine it'd be like this I'll give you a quick tour latex it's actually quite bright and hard to see inside now and we have some lovely little villa and a beautiful pool you can see behind me so we arrived super late last night grabbed pizza wine and pistachio ice cream literally all the cliches when you come to Italy so that's pretty much all we did last night and the lovely owner and his daughter think it's his daughter who is Dorotea of Villa Dorotea they showed us Brown quickly and now I think we're going to head to the beach rented a car but we do have a slight blip in that there's a power cuts and the gates to get out the villa require power so we're just gonna try a key fob on our set of keys and we're going to go noose explore hey guys I thought I would just update you because I haven't picked up a camera very much today I'm super shiny forgot load of Sun cream on um it's very echo in here so we did end up going for a drive but it wasn't very fruitful actually we drove into the town of Marsala but I think maybe it was like siesta time or something because everything was very closed and we drove to a marina which was kind of like an old fishing village style marina but quite industrial so didn't really hang around there too much and then we drove to a beach which we've been recommended to go to but it was quite quite almost like a building site like doing workmen everywhere quite a lot like slabs of rubble on the beach and the restaurant was closed so then we decided that we just come back to the villa because it's nice and sunny we didn't want to waste any more time in the car so we went to a supermarket we got some pasta some really nice parmesan and some meat and we cooked lunch here and we've just spent the past couple of hours out by the pool enjoying the sunshine and I thought I just give you a very quick minute all while the lighting is good so we are now in the like main area it's kind of a very very open plan that Villa so this is like the now and cherry got some nice little painting from the walls we've got a big TV like lounge area over here a very pretty fireplace behind me some little candles I think they're I wish a limoncello but it's not limoncello is it citronella consider nella candles and a dining table and then through here is the kitchen where we have oh my gosh we had a nightmare earlier so they never used their dishwasher before we had to take the plastic wrap off the dishwasher and when we set it off not immediately but like 20 minutes later there was a power cut and we text the owners and he was like oh maybe you've exceeded the energy balance of the house so I think we've kind of buggered things up a little bit and then because of the power cut we couldn't get out of the property because the electric gates and the works we had to yank them open so not the best start um but yes so that's this is the kitchen from that or super really nice tiles yeah very pretty very typical Sicilian I keep getting random cravings for coke and I never drink coke so maybe I'm having a bit of trouble oh and also I keep noticing even though the Sun is not very strong I'm really getting quite handsew wonderful thing about Sicily is great tanning so I've just come down to the driveway and you can get a better view of the villa here looks really beautiful up on the hill and the view really is great beautiful view and that is C we also rented a car from one of the companies at the airport it has a really good decision because it's quite nice to be able to drive around and discover new places although I have to say driving on the opposite side of the road is proving to be quite challenging ticularly with Charlie and around here the roads are all like what's the word brick either sides that are quite narrow and Holly has not got very good spatial awareness so quite scary look at that oh my god this is so exciting it's really hard to do onehanded John me to go yeah can you do it in a scenic way for the vlog make it look really pretty look we both happy special flavored ice cream treats what have you got Magnum pistache oh and I've got Magnum card oh I'm pretty sure I just said I was having a Magnum flavored card or I meant hotdogs pistachio flavor bombs so we've come out for dinner at a place I think it's gone it's a salt farm which seems to be a running theme this summer I've been to three now I can tell you all about how salt is produced if you really want to know but I just came outside quickly we're already heating inside because I wanted to show you this sunset have a look behind me it's so beautiful evening it is our second evening Emily and we've come to the main parts of town here Marcela and where are we moment well I don't know via via 11 Maggio yeah great memory and yeah so I think we found like the main pedestrian area thoroughfare it's quite a busy streets very difficult Italian we walk past lots pizzerias but we did have a piece of lunch so we're trying to find something a little bit different for dinner what do you someone meeting something meeting because we're going to have a little explore lots of nice little shops you might put into a few actually on the other now I won't drop your bill because we're in the shade in the street we've got a little tipsy jumpsuit I'm like a Primark bag I'm always ringing another jacket makes and virtually anything my entire life and morning riding our bike rounds but now black Madame Simone is off the coast of Sicily and it's really really nice charlie didn't want to spread bikes because apparently I'm a spasm bike but actually it was pour soap that fell off her bike feeling a bit wounded but we've had a really good time cycling around the islands we found a few nice little coves and we've come to beautiful little beach house it's so very windy situation you so you're giving the bike back we are all bike that's probably been on the bikes for about six hours today the quite unkind look how Italian Matt looks it is stripes you don't so it's a Liana oh now we've found a lovely little Piazza so we're currently on a mission to

"no_ALFIES BIRTHDAY WEEKEND.txt"	"hello everybody welcome back to our house it's been a while since I've logged some of you may know if you've been following my Instagram or my Twitter that we have been away on a family holiday for a week in Greece it was so lovely I had the most amazing time it was really relaxing but I have to say is really really nice to be back although we have yet to unpack which I think rhymed I got up at 6 a.m. this morning it was still dark outside and in fact I'm not gonna lie it was 550 it was 550 and my phone was dead so I plugged my phone in waited for it to turn on and check so it was 550 and I thought ah do I try and go back to sleep or do I just do I wake up I did say to you I'm getting up because I didn't want you to wake up and be like where the hell is she gone it was really over I was like wide awake because obviously in Mykonos they're two hours ahead so we've been waking up at like 8:00 9:00 which UK time was like six seven and I think I'm still like used to that it's not read jetlag it's just I don't know I'm used to different time zone now which I'm not actually gonna complain about because I did get up this morning at 6 a.m. and I came downstairs and I tidied all the kitchen turned on the heating cuz it was freezing and started the day early and now it's like what's the time ten past nine and me and help me on both up I'm ready for the day like showered than everything oh how much do you love it though this is so good we should go on holiday if I ever start waking up late or going to bed really late in the night can you just book me like it's just a twoday holiday yeah and I tell you my hotel everything just two days so it skips my time zone that Dubai do you remember we were waiting for hours earlier it was Dubai was like nuts you're waking every like 5:00 a.m. like right let's start the day then so it's a beautiful day it's actually Saturday it's the day before Alfie's birthday I'll probably make this into a two day vlog so this will be the Alpha birthday o'clock it's really funny because everyone always says you never do anything for alfea's birthday people don't understand Alfie does not like birthday know your own birthday it's not that I don't like getting older they want to get an older it's gonna sound Greece because my job is kind of won back saying I just don't like attention on me I I could have a hundred percent about so that I hope he does not like when you so our fees so Alfie would never speak to me again if I took him to a restaurant surprised in front of loads of people and then everyone sang happy birthday to hit that Alfie is the worst thing anyone could do to him but then if you put me on a stage an awesome yeah it makes me know everything you do any job it's when people over there for you like it's like it's almost like for me and there's no expectation because if I can fulfill like it's like they were there to listen to me do at all it's like you're doing something giving them what they want yeah and for me a birthday present and they give it to me in their life open it and I'm like oh my god the pressure to like it because they're there it's so like you might you may have noticed last year we all gave out for the presence and the vlogs like cut off because I feels like I can't open these on vlog like after you film everything in your life is like I know but I just can't like you doesn't even like opening presents in front of me let alone if I have a camera front of my hand yeah so we do have lovely times on alfea's birthday guys amount of times I was out from laying mom's be not even in love the present she's building like this sorry to do this Steve I am so happy with the presents employees yeah yeah Alfie's birthday weekend okay and it's not okay why are we playing golf Alfie because the things that I like to do you must spare time for fun odd things often that the family like to do for example then bowling it going so much better this year all these weird things of you you have yet no you have by basically I like all the weird hobbies like gokart involved in trampoline so childish like so it was a little punch restaurant your birthday I knew you wouldn't want it like that guys learn to the driving range you learnt they golf whose idea was this it was actually my idea I was like I know what you would want to do play goal and then we're gonna go for a lovely roast it's gonna be really really nice I'm really excited I felt my hair's got very blonde I we talked about until just now I have this dress actually excuse the back and if you take your jacket slightly down turn around I said like imagine that bit wasn't there said ah we got into a Victorian wedding yeah that's a bad thing I do I've made one medieval comment and you think I don't like it I do like yeah it's very like rock we've got him you're the video that we filmed when we're on holidays like this is a bikini and wearing this is that I'm dead now you're wearing like leather jacket and black and did I buy you that yeah I did oh you don't wear the one I bought you I was with you when you bought that this is from Zara and then these boots are actually from H&M I used to absolutely hate hmmm shoes and they really stepped up this autumn and then these little glasses which and then I have a lip color on which is a color pop one and I'll tell you it when I know it will go into town now if you can hear crackling fire by the way it's not a crackling fire it's this candle no it sounds like there's like a flame in so I'm taking that block all my autumn candles I was like right we're back up holiday it's officially autumn now the sun's come out so well jinxed it we brought the Sun back and you Missy moo I see you tell you who I see I Daniel I missed you she's been so cute haven't you he's sitting in the Sun he gets a little bitter walking down poo Avenue honestly why not them bigger than your foot but it definitely was bigger than mine the whole reason for coming into town this morning was because I needed to get Alfie's wrapping paper but somehow Alfie's with me so you're just gonna have to not look at your wrapping paper but I know you can go in the shop without me I'll go into another shop I need to get some two microphones for a new project I'm working on I thought you just bought two microphones you know why I need oh yeah that's true no I can always get the image on the same boat whilst you go get mark yeah okay let's do that and then I think we're gonna grab breakfast because I had a little something but I'm quite hungry but you know why I'm quite hungry because I think now would be like lunch no it's four minutes past 10:00 I'm gonna go into Oliver bonus because they do the best wrapping paper ever being on Odin so Cena bet he now wants me to go in here well we can cross green man this is so exciting breakfast has arrived we decided to share some pancakes and also got like full English's like we're never gonna eat there they had to bring up like another table because this is a small table business Oh you always order down these stairs liquidcooled bills is right but it's all how to redesign well there's no less section this is a shop good yak we just walked past I've never seen it before it's for yan it's a yarn and knitting specialist that's you know what I'm gonna say that's me oh you're on holiday come on I'm still walking this is funny throwing on holiday oh god I literally can't walk when we were on holiday I discovered that Alfie used to knit not when he was little when he was a teenager he would sit and knit I mean I think it's quite endearing it's quite cute it made me like think you know what he's got so many skills he's a man of many talents what and I think Oh some mint outside this purse also has amazing horses this is alby's interests you know we were looking I'm not walking like that I'm not walking like that that's a Larry why are you telling you oh my god Simon Says inshallah we have some coffee I'm gonna and show me your feet could be anything could be me speak and it could be anything okay repeat after me I'm in so much pain I don't even look that saucy it doesn't even look like there's nothin bloody they even making it where does it hurt there Oh buddy take these off no no that's not how you take them off you take them off there it's time to wrap Alfie's presents so the wrapping paper that I went for was this one which is like navy with a little like party popper streamers on it and I've got a couple of other ones how can I take this off with one hand there we go I got this one with like stars and moons and I've got two of those and then I got this one which is like a blue paint splat so those are my present wrapping options and then I got this one I have been keeping the presence hidden in here find these dressinggowns this is like my secret stash of presents so I need to wrap these now but holy crap they're big aren't they also I've thought of turned a spare room into a autumnal backdrop I was getting too impatient so I put the fairy lights back up which you may have seen in my last main channel video and I've got the little tree here and I've got a few little Halloweeny pumpkiny or to me esque items oh I've got ahead of myself but I like it it's cozy done NOLA she got really bored when I was wrapping those these three are the same which is why they look identical and then the other four are all five one two three four five are all different but to go to each place to get the clue for the next place which is where the present will be I haven't written out so I think I might do in a birthday card so they'll be a few birthday cards from me but there are quite a lot I have that I bike it's like whenever I see a cute card I always buy it just to give him randomly so I feel like I might write it all in individual little happy birthday cards every time we open this one there's another clue and then like another nice message I think I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go and get some more cards Alfie can't hear me it starts off a card so I'm gonna give him this in the morning and then in here is the clue to the first and then attached to each present is the new clue and then I've also done a sticky note so I know where to hide them in the morning because otherwise I'm gonna get really confused with the order and that clue leads you to the very top of the house etc so I've done that for all of them and in each card I've done a clue on one side and then just like a nice little message from the other side I don't know if he will let me film him opening the presents were doing this because as we were talking about earlier he doesn't really like that sort of things so that might be all you see of it until I can film him afterwards but yeah it is such a beautiful day today so nice apart from the dog barking and everything how have you guys been Oh found a wet Donuts let me know how you've been keep me updated what's your week been like how has going back to school being or if you've started school or if you've just got to uni when do you need to go back I don't know I feel like this part of the year goes really quickly now like I remember this time last year how much I thought oh we've got ages and yes I'm excited for Christmas and I know all the things I want to do and I know all the content I want to create but I've got so long it's fine and then thinking shite it's a week till Christmas like it goes so so quick this a little bit apparently she was doing this all week we were gone barking at the bottom of the garden smell I bought this from home cents and it's a smoked pumpkin flavor candle and it has one of these weird wigs that makes it sound like the crackling fire this lipsticks not holding out too well in fact I appear to have smudged it all over my face the lipstick I'm wearing to be fair I haven't touched it up at all or today it's called mamacita and it's me I love Sarah I love Sarah 2x color pop so that is what I'm wearing it's gone a little bit patchy but then darker colors tend to go a bit patchy and it's also bleeding a little bit around my lips but target god oh we still haven't done this oh it's the one bit of getting back off holiday I just don't really look forward to if I want to morning everybody it is de and it is Alfie's birthday I can't believe he's does anyone else just feel like I get older and alfie doesn't like Alf is just not aging but I am like I'm gonna be and he's still gonna be like 26 it's fine whatever we started the morning with breakfast in bed and then I did the treasure hunt which went down really really well Alfie found all the presents obviously my clues weren't that hard and where is he actually are you down here yeah I made a few jumps so good oh your parents are here good timing anyway anyway tell her about your treasure hunt I didn't film it guys because Alfie filmed it so if you want to go and see it you can watch his channel I thought would be a bit overkill we were both walking around with both our cameras so I find I find that so one of those people that find it incredibly difficult to ankle in also in this vlog yesterday so yeah it was like the least invasive chilled little treasure hunt oh so lovely yeah you're doing that with us affray brave anyway the effort you went to July go outside early on because some of them were like some of them were in the garage one was in the garage one was by the trampoline one was on the trampoline and it was next to it but what I loved the most was that the wet battery just died I'm quickly trying to I think I might take these off actually here we go yeah I'm saying the weather was really nice this morning it was a like a crisp but the Sun came out was perfect I'm Andrea thanks guys you're very Navy both of you we get with these presents as well do you like it haven't seen you in ages secret cakes have arrived for short and poppy chat but same for as well oh wow for me yeah yeah we can have it for pudding I'm not even how they either take away which one the spiky one yeah I like that one yes yeah you come with me I want to say the Frog yeah I didn't like I'm good on a little plain coffee he's just laughed he had enough he got 224 and for I don't want to do this no more he's gone sixes about me at your birthday happy birthday happy happy birthday Lisa I thought you fell over this sad I was probably to say where we're going say it now let's go into the to also take gold oh yeah we're going to take a look back to the driving range I never been to a driving range no I crazy I don't think I like where here are what's wrong so did i right well this looks really busy and I don't know what we have to do I think we just hit the wall I think that's the point so hopefully we can't be too bad oh we should that's like the kids one okay now yeah I don't see it oh well done baby don't throw it I'm gonna hurt your back Oh papi missed it come on there you got this yeah that was good just keep your eyes on the ball I love that you're both sat in a chair now Shawn you've so nearly got that turns out I'm not very good at golf you are good it's your first time behold your Papa case and then hit that target target you hit no less hot or you nearly hit the act of 50 targets I think you could get really hard and I can't it's been my hand just really hurt I have roast has arrived we have a dinner was delish and now I think the boys are gonna go and play a game of archery because happy parents bought a what's it called a target and a bow and arrow and extra arrows all the stuff you need and the girls are gonna play rummy Cub this is for accept sighs Amanda sorting it into piles and papi is playing but she's not here yet as always I'm singing Irish or basically spent the last like half an hour cry laughing at different things you can do and then rewind on Instagram story if you guys are following me on my Instagram then go over and follow me because that's why you're going over there sometimes we had poppy made it look like she was just being like dragged upstairs by nothing Shawn doing some weird like creepy things spitting water but if any of you know anything to do in like normal time that looks hilarious if you rewind it please let me know because we're always messing around with that function on Instagram story and it's really funny it makes me laugh but it's difficult to try and think of things that would look funny if you reverse them although I think things that are really normal and mundane look funny when you try and reverse them like walking because then you play it forward and you look so strange but it's such a simple thing so let me know well Barbie food and airman back up your bar so don't follow Alfie's Instagram story oh my god you've not said how birthday to him on Twitter this is a very good example guys of sometimes not everything is on Twitter I was a really nice double chin have you had the best day all my presents I like your necklace papi and Shawn got Alfie a necklace it's really cool and now we've got lemaise soundtrack on overall it's a really good day Shawn's already like halfway home you look so much like your brother then in my camera you look so much like your brother then yeah this is what you do to me every day older now where's puppy go in

rushed because it starts them out team it probably a good fight my way through this experience serious power walking right now now you can read the map I'm very bad reading much I think I took much casualties of us will be rain of it we are losing in academia and we're back playing famous drum roll Mike Angelo's David so we just finished off in the Galleria and we thought the famous my graduate David last time masters like me was a native that I was not peaceful haha I think this history of the history behind it I feel what you don't get if I want to meet it by myself I think I was a student I did after I read all the little science person that's all that explains it so nonetheless although I just think it makes such a difference if you get your bike and it makes it spirit the billionaire III more gallery a lot more you know a lot more better tissue you learn so much more than car so we're on the walk again if ever needs a kite and pretty much walk a yeah yeah it's really small but there's so much to see how much culture probably the air pieces as well so we can hear what the Pope is saying is a realtor make it was quite loud we've got these actually should subscribing the area and our way now to the next spot which is the Cathedral community we are also asking for akhirah the RPG is the wedding in mexicali miracle let me salivate so let you dance that I'm by a guy Hey so will you come back from tour number two Thanks right amazing husband who just loves history and culture and walking I am twenty thousand steps or even more we feel like I said for a week I was really it was really really good so we changed because we're having accident I really move but we thought which is had a little bit Chani bit where we share with you some of the things we covered in our quiet time to some of the things we've been flexing on lately because you know it has been so helpful for us and hopefully you know it can help anything guys out there as well but we thought we'd do something more different want to take a topic sometimes we just do that as well for study so the shittest topic we feel we need to grow in more I think that topic to its individual studies and when we come together we discuss it and kind of bounce ideas off each other and that's what I believe marriage should be like you know iron sharpens iron and then yeah that's what really works for us so a topic that we were focusing on this week is attitudes and thoughts and the u.s. is generally important for spiritual life but it's so important for us as a married couple especially as we approach five years of marriage and that's been something I've always been challenged with quite a lot but we've grown in and even never stopped learning about so we kind of came back and revisit that topic I love to share with you guys what we learn and some of the scriptures we found a really helpful in terms of helping us adjust the way we think that we've been meditating on is what is abilities Philippian placement really good cuz so I'll read this one and now here brothers and sisters one final thing fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable you know I think about things that excellent and worthy of great don't think about lies misconceptions you know is this is is true and pure honorable things you know always think about the positives and what is true and you know don't listen to you know the lies of the enemy about your relationships thank you you know I do the other scriptures in romance which of that not copying the world the covers of behavior sisters world be transformed by the renewing of your minds and that's so so important you have to let God renew your mind if you're gonna ultimately see changes happen and that goes hand in hand with prayer I think we bypass the whole point the women that had come to God and communicate with him and speak to him and he's a good father he's there he wants to talk to us the enemy goes around probably not like rolling I am looking for fun to kill feelings joy and you looking to pull our hearts away from each other pull hearts away from our spouse so to change our thinking we ultimately have to know God or heart yes thank you hot and I'm just praying God changed myself changer to change my wife but sometimes she's asking God you know it sounds a little bit of humility say God you know helped me to see truth and help me to analysis me help me to change and to help me to see my spouse the same ways that crises them so I hope this helps and we need to get ready for dinner grub I'm hungry so we are off to dinner how old how we're always walking reading or up as we go home do a quick change start evening a tire and look like the evening time it's also sunny here babies in the last room the night time has gone so quickly we protect so much in this trip a lot psyche and what kind of good for meat and also family he had a local pastor another one with really good reviews do I not to run home this way and this our family is really good or safe okay rich man okay I think the great thing about this house is that you don't actually need a car there becomes a Florence do not get a car thing the thing people get one and completely regret it and she don't need one at all everything is within walking distance I think I can talk much long about to be some more power key I guys made it just in time tricky inside everything is injustice has a combination of I need to look like Facebook let's come Stephanie conversation see na na se na well that's not how you spell it for everything you came round little yeah another talking came in shine get table and alike I'm sorry again thank you and they said no but they definitely look like or 11 is actually very popular great do what you do and all that work and I rang them up like can I get a table for a solo cage not very clear not speak up speak up what may might like Samuel Samuel I'm like Sam like sad

"no_Back Yard Progress  Billy & Pat.txt"	"hey it's Billy and it's Pat and we've been working on the backyard we've been spending this summer crafting what our backyard is gonna be but the first thing we had to do was get rid of the shed I shed by good riddance nobody will miss you now I guess we just had to paint that piece of the house I wasn't painted awesome I've been all day edging the driveway so we kind of didn't know that over here we actually had a cement base we kind of thought there was but then when we took the shed off it seemed like it was just like really pressed down dirt well I brushed it a broom that I shoveled I did all of the edging around it if you look this one is level with the earth which is good if we were to get like a hot tub or something get in there it's progress I'm happy about it I have this whole space here who knows what we'll do with it I'm excited though we're in the backyard and the day that we've all been waiting for has arrived the backyard is mostly cleared the old ugly shed is gone and we now have a nice little flat cement pad we rented the roto tiller so we could turn over it the soil in the backyard Billy will be operating the machinery I will be standing here in my greenery it's green did you get it all right sir how are we feeling I'm really nervous I feel like there's a lot of gears on this thing there are quite a few gears but I feel like I can handle I got like the deaf man much here is that we call sure just learn that on the youtubes hey gal yeah so I don't know we're just gonna get it on there okay so this is a much different process than I actually thought it was going to be I thought it was gonna be a lot harder and a lot noisier and kind of chaotic but seems like it's gonna be like a slow go probably have to pass over the lawn several times to get it right but you know it's not bad how is it is it as hard as you thought it would be yeah right it's not as intense and just so you don't think that Billy's doing everything and I'm looking just cute I'm using this axe and I am digging up all of the big roots that the roto tiller can't get and as you can see my root pile is doing alright so you know teamwork about leopardprint flood because we flipped over this big teach us to mend and look update with him with him doing he's really fat but he gets really long look at his eye he's a grower not a shower tell me what are the names okay scientific name is Bemis Maximus okay literally biggest slug I knew it it's Latin for disgusting vulgar animal wait first of all did you see how fat it was before now look how long it is now Rickon shady so cute shady ill ill ill ill ill ill I put him on a rock around the dirt put him on the dirt and by the rock okay oh my god it's really cute oh bugger City there you go bud there you go enjoy well that's get that out of there enjoy the snail graveyard which is you your new habitat taking a little break from digging and tilling to assemble these garden beds that we bought what what are they aluminum you know what some kind of metal no okay these are all metal garden beds metal garden beds we got three of them calm metal garden bed calms where we're not sponsored but thanks these look great we got three of these ten foot raised beds that we're gonna kind of use to edge the driveway we probably said that before in another clip but for those of you just watching we're gonna try to edge out with this and even out some of the parts of the lawn that are on upgrade so this might help keep things from washing away and keep the drainage going away from the house so we're building one so that we can see how it looks before we build the other ones yep how you feelin I like what it looks like kind of nicer than I thought oh I'm happy about it I think it's a good purchase nice they're not that hard to put together either no the metal is a little sharp so we're just trying to be cautious but it's really the only thing other than that's just screwing a bunch of yeah okay the backyard is in great shape as you can see we've made a lot of progress and we installed our planters we've flattened everything out and just like magic whenever there's a tricky job to do my fatherinlaw bill magically appears to help us with this job so he and Billy are putting down the grass seed in the backyard we're trying to get it down now because we should have some rain in the next couple days which is good because it'll help BC get down into the dirt and turn into grass right science is this as exciting down there as it is up here just kind of looks like you're making a mess ah oh great okay there we go look at that grass looking beautiful it's a lot smaller and bluer than I thought it would be but I guess it has to grow or something so so it's been a week and a half since we planted the grass so come have some sprouted happening oh can you see it can you see it it's slowly coming in got some rocks to get out of there who cares just

snow like members of stars face I wonder if you just rock up and do it you're going to dump like Creek gently yeah here we go then so then master circle you think anyone's going to turn up or do you think we just crack on and make it then it's pretty cool isn't it there you go going into locket babe doodles what's all that for the camp fire my pyrotechnic child is building a campfire that what's quite aggressively the kids are just happy we're just doing their own thing Liam and Pete so very serious we just have to go and look at the envelope and they told us at the foundation in late and it's May is interlocked the foundation and he could be such you know yeah and he was like around here I'm reassured it up I'm sure you hear situated around here pretty sure inside and Pacific losses completely over there interlocked even keep the lost all intracompany Liz and you have like men and dads in your group bring them this is this is not an activity for the kids is it something better we have the older children right come on yet have all the eight groups of a stay like in the North I'm looking around you got the Student Health Trust over it just adds a lastly but I don't care who sees the millinery God Bernard Arnault as a crosstable all the children of want to go sees what are you doing just collecting flowers and things lovely a ribbon fantastic wow you guys have did a great job we're finished and Liam's report was I'm happy with that someone thinks I have it up there we are there's I don't see it doctor just is so close see what Apple you're not worried about me at all are you oh dear we have some lunch and we are taking the bikes again to go through me the bikes will be the bloody death of me it's like my body feels like a lump of playdoh slowly sinking into a pin and that paddle is going all up where I don't want it to be so we're going back on it again go swimming because that's what parents do and you love your children so much it's like Vicky water and grace this is the pool from the outside cool like a tropical something or other and you can see they're like that's a little rapid thing that's and some curly slides on your side of it here I'm just putting my bike out here here we go so no film and push the bike but it's so nice inside it's got all like jungle stuff God try a little bit in there I'm not going to swim I'm just no fortune sides but the tricky to fill in pull oh I'm so glad to just be pushing it when you go and then we're returning the bikes I'll take goodbye to the bikes too far with me something I'm really impressed with in the changing room space and Leslie Winkle is that their detection proof you just want a single cubicle with them is a section action dress okay so it's like a family cubicle and it's really big three spacious people like its own been its own likely to change thing and just might see would have faced up overcame and just me Liam and three girls competing to but I had all three girls in one cubicle is important to do so proud it was kinda unique yeah someone's read things like the finfisher at home but more money right okay the wave machine it's really good it's really good standby to the bike this trailer has served as well I mean not sure how it's there do you base that you're lucky yeah but it serves as well a bow tiny bike some big bike and my bag go to the car the most giant carpark ever we're packing out to come home we've driven the car around the lodge we got my hearing zucchini I'll come out here to your muscle sneaker 5 it so people go yeah um yeah we're packing up to head back to camp you're going to stay an extra night and it was at school in the morning but that we've asked for us to get home and feed the cats and all that stuff so we are back to final thoughts central Central Park sent us I really glad you love them I don't know if you can tell from my intro I was a bit skeptical I like oh but not really like the British white British Holiday Park kind of a gal but this has really really exceeded all my expectations and if I can looking over their ranking house I didn't get to do that like a lot of stuff that I still haven't done so I think we will come back next year make a bit of a tradition of it so I'm glad we came it is expensive that was my biggest regret was like one I don't want to go to like summer camps and it's really expensive for a summer camp but it's not like that it's like a very nice environment to be in so I can see why and everywhere is well maintained and well thought out and planned stuff like that so five stars for me which is surprising because I was not expecting to be as five stars instead of the cows and Kent videos simple so you might respond to me you know my number you can sponsor me right I'm going to just leave your hair cut off the tree instead of going keep crying because saying goodbye is hard to do so I will bid you farewell and I'll see you soon and I love you a lot goodbye"	4219

Frank perform of the day replica lazy Sunday morning focus the Knights a bit dirty but I love this my outfits these days is so pants let me try and focus oh my god this is so boring for this will end up in my other dilemma is that obviously I don't look super pregnant like you know what I'm going to so I'm going on the tube and if it's busy I'm going to want like obviously like give me a seat there's a seat available so but I don't like that pregnant unless I'm like I stand there like ah so hopefully it's not busy I hope I hope so B I'm trying this jumper from hmm I'll try link it down below um creepy hand and then this jacket is from ASOS like last year leggings from Isabella Oliver I believe I'll link them down below Maternity ones they're really comfy and thick and trainers just a necessity at this point because walking is such an effort and I think I'm gonna on the back of the door here this is way oh right yet that happens all the time this is where I keep all my life bags and stuff I'm gonna see if I can brick if this one goes with my outfit yeah that it's quite cool I think you sorry if the light here is not great but yeah I think it adds something to my outfit because it's a bit bit bit shit isn't it let's go I'm heading to drive I'm just going to see if they've got any spaces and I'm guessing that they won't so if they do I'd be really happy and if not when I look for somewhere else wherever I get my nails done okay here it is it's next to cycle which I've always wanted to go to cycle I need to go there when I'm after I'm given birth and I'm done by droid believe so so night because I left my camera in my back because I sat down left my camera my bag and then I couldn't like use my nails while I was in there but if I was sat next to Alex who's the she's the beauty editor Glamour magazine and I don't if you guys remember my blog from Paris with white cell but I met her then and I love her through side next to each other and like chatting and I wanted the nude so she suggested one of the news that she had last time and then we mixed it so I thought there should me before I forget because I'll show you my nails later but I got there shinee's and pajamas slippers thinking called my blog that wrong but yet it was so nice to see her and like chat to someone it's really funny cause earlier I was like oh I wish I had a friend near here and then like I got chatting to someone who I knew I was there so it was like seeing a friend you know my people who are going to Liberty and look at the baby and just have a little brown and then head home and start editing so pretty decorations not sure what to do with myself now it's so manic apparently it's the busiest day of the year shopping so I chose the worst day a hat to vlog Liberty it's so pretty oh my god mannequin here I think you're gonna head home lots of queue for Ben's cookies is huge I could not be asked away in that I'm getting kind of pains so I'm just gonna try and hit home anyways get snuck from the way home but look what that's all over said the train I was on was getting delayed every single stops I decided to get off and just get a taxi home oh god I'm hope just home god that was such klava I got it so stupid but I got really emotional because like I got off the train and then none of the traffic was moving everything was standstill and I was and like Jason's out and it's like I there was no way of just getting home and I just felt so frustrated because I wanted to get home for the dogs and yeah I just had a little like pregnancy like got teary and then I got an ADD and I've gone they're going to taxi and we were stuck in a bit of traffic then I go home anyway so I think I'm gonna start making some sort of dinner oh I'll show you guys what I got I just I got a concealer oh my god it was I just can't get over I can't go to how busy it was honestly that was a Rhys tupid idea to have gone but at least I got my nails done hey hey boys in this back here I've got my magazines from yesterday so I'm gonna hopefully sit down and just read my magazines and cheer myself up a little bit oh I'm so attracted to pregnancy I was saying I don't like such a gray because I'm always wearing a cardigan I'm just making some dinner and I really want something I really want some like veg like I want something healthy I feel like you know you just eaten like comfort food for a while and it just makes you feel recrop Hey so I'm just going to make like a salad um making like a salad with spinach avocado tomato and then I'm adding a few new potatoes which I never ever usually eat but I've just got them because I just kind of wanted to change my diet up a bit I'm so bored of eating the same things that's what I'm doing and they're so I've made my salad just waiting for my potatoes just watching Alex sign and I think I'm gonna add this on top okay this is my dinner I hope it's enough it should be and I hope I didn't put too much dressing on Frank's waiting as usual that's not V though and she always starts kick hit she's since God ages got at 20 weeks she always kicks when just as I make food so funny you're gonna eat it's fine just about to eat okay so it's a few hours later I've done some editing and I'll spare you the details of how I'm feeling because it's just a bit depressing I'm just gonna do myself a little lush bath I can't know what this is if it's a bubble bar or oh it does look like a bubble bar what are you I bet loads of you know what this is anyway a little bit listen and then I've also got intergalactic black oh I might just put this thing it's not a good well oh my god that tiny bit has worked so well also we got this from Amazon this is the best thing ever like I would put this in a favorites video but I feel like it's boring to put in but yeah Jason just got it from Amazon it's just so it's comfy to sit in the bar and honestly it's just the best like that and this I think Nikki

try and show you guys tomorrow in better light but I really really love them and yeah like I was saying I think I was trying to say earlier I thought I like told Alex that I was wanting to go for a nude so she kind of stood it like she's she that's really hard to say she should suggest it mix in these two shades and then she suggested got it um yeah so there it's really pretty and yeah feel really nice and groomed now and feminine and then when I was in I went into Topshop really quickly because it was absolutely manic I got this which and I've been wanting to get my hands on it for a while it's the ex1 invisible liquid foundation I got it in the color 11 and I'm hoping it's kind of match because they only had this color they have loads of this color on one other one which was too dark I think so I'm going to test this out and then and I've really wanted to get a new concealer so I just went with my like the this version of my corrector it looks like this is just the boy and tinted eye bright and I've talked about it before my channel but I love it and I don't have my last one dried up so now I'm gonna sit and read some magazines I got Elle Cosmo and then another Cosmo I

"no_CELEBRATING MY YOUTUBE GOAL"	"need to change my battery already cameras about to run that charge haven't even started to vlog yet take to the daily vlog right good morning guys good morning how you doing I hope you have an in lovely day whatever you up to wherever you are in the world isn't it crazy I was chatting to a friend yesterday a friend of Steve cook about how people watch my videos from all over the world and how insane that actually is and he said that he looked back at a video of mine from like I think it was seven or eight years ago and in the video I completely forgot this even existed I said that my dream goal ever on YouTube was to hit 2,000 subscribers so I just want to take a moment to celebrate that we've hit 2,000 subscribers because I know we're way way past that I know we're got like five and a half million of ones blog nearly four million on this channel maybe 2 million on my gaming channel box but I just want to take them over to sit back and just think my goal on YouTube was to hit two thousand subscribers that was my goal so if you're out there and you wanted to make youtube videos and you're wanting it to be a thing in your goal is 10, subscribers or 1000 subscribers just know that my daughter was just gone and they're interrupting them all Amazon delivery right back in one minute just know that if you're out there and you wanting to get 1000 subscribers or 10,000 or whatever it is possible it seems super far away that set your goals high I set my goal of two thousand subscribers I didn't even know the day it is possible to achieve your dreams and even far exceed them I just want you to know that because at the moment it might seem like you're super far away and that it's going to take ever and it's never going to happen but it will it will happen you just keep working bloomin hard I've spent the vast majority of this morning going through CVS which is something that I've never had to do before like I've employed members of staff before quite a few times now and I've even had to file members of staff before but that is far harder to fire somebody that is to hire something like hyerin's like the noise this thing firing someone I literally felt like I was like ripping our manners so hot anyways if you're here to talk about that today let's talk about TVs I'm currently looking for a looking to hire somebody a creative role this isn't me asking you guys to apply for the job I've I've submitted job search advertisement things online and and since last week when the advertisement went up said that I was looking for a George Adamson garden for a job it just says that it just says that somebody is looking for a job I didn't said that it was myself I've had 92 people apply since Thursday like I thought I was going to get like five or six people apply if I was lucky so I'm now kind of stuck in the position where I've got so many people applying which is amazing that I'm spending so much time looking for everybody see these and their work and their show reels and their instagrams and everything to be able to see whether they're right and then like I'm spending so much time I thought I was just going to meet up with five or six people interview them chat with them and see whether they like the role but little did I know that I'll be spending a long time looking through tons of CDs to whittle them down to the list of people that wouldn't that are will eventually me don't worry I'm still going to be filming these both myself and still going to be editing these logs myself this I'm hiring for a role that you guys mmm you might say I'll tell you about it once you find the right person I'll tell you all about it and stuff but for now I'm just going through a ton and so far I've got four maybes five maybes and two people that I definitely want to meet and I haven't gone through all of them yet so things looking good things are looking really really good it's a rainy day today which you probably assume that I don't like but since we've got this conservatory and the glass ceiling up here it's actually so nice when it rains and then if it's just me but I think it's quite a popular thing to license the noise of rain hitting glass I find it really relaxing quite therapeutic I don't if you guys are going to be able to see the rain on the camera so it really really fine but a lot of it I'm also in dungarees for the first time today I ordered these about a week ago and there was a couple of days ago but I haven't tried them on until now I've currently got them flipped down they're ripped as well and I've got the bottoms turn up and I really really like them let me pop you here and show you comment down below what you think little outfit of the day you know I never do stuff like that I never do health care of the days anyways I'm going to crack on regional either these TVs and hope you find new member of the pointlessblog team it is time for a dum dum Dona the people that came to my last meeting yesterday bought me all of these doughnuts how nice is that guys they bought me all this like so many it's just the one I want here are having a quick break I'm gonna squat session with mark you warming up your legs yeah you know how bad I am at this all right now probably about minutes oh my god do it for one minute I'll be yeah bit lower mark that's it no it's a large degree not as nice no no you can go you can go of it that's that's 90 oh he'll be all right and half the time I know what she's gonna do this is not going to make you know your body it is fun yeah okay because you're not ready yet why I really hurt already take your mind to a different place ahh oh yeah oh you're like wow this is so bad I have to swear he's gonna give up first Oh Timothy noise I want to get it started I've done dumb got it everybody watch my god if you did that for me second I thought like we'll be a I'm so funny how'd you feel now like need a shower oh now yeah oh crap trying to carry too many things at once drop my phone please don't be even more cracked than oh that sucks even more crap than what it was before this is why you don't try and carry everything in one hand and in behind the camera I've also got my keys in my hand balance in them and now someone's calling me as well how the heck am I going to open this door let me balance you back on ice pressing the key on my keyboard ah drop my keys Oh horrid Elise I need to get this fixed today absolutely busted the top bit there has been crack for like three months but now I've just done this all right close the store hey how you doing I'm good you want to go to town I need to fix my iPhone literally whilst you were calling me whilst walking up the passing part into my office dropped my phone smash all the screen no it's good it's exactly what I wanted today just catching up with my PA on everything going on at the moment our internet in the office has stopped working for some reason so my vlog is currently 67% uploaded and it won't do any more so I mean I do need to go into town anyway to fix my iPhone screen something left to upload my vlog whilst I'm in town probably is the Apple Store Internet kind of work that not ideal I'm going to go to town to upload goodbye farewell you actually are marks got no underwear on he's naked is Nikki right captured a bit guys do you need anything from town bloody L got a big enough rock with you is a big old crystal do you actually I used to collect crystals when I was younger oh right catching a bit guys or haven't got a jumper and it's raining is that stupid I feel like this really stupid feel lucky it's not cold feel like I'm going to get incredibly wet I'm not actually cold look at me who would have thought I would have been wearing dungarees I also got a new bag but it doesn't look how I want it to look if that makes sense it's a leather bag it's like this it's a Gucci bag however I absolutely love it but I really really want it to be like beaten up and all that oldschool and at the moment is like brandnew fresh leather which M I think it looks cool I was so torn whether to actually go for it and buy it or not and then I realized and I don't know how I didn't realize this when I first asked the man to get one of the bags off of the shelf to show me this snake here I used to have that pet snake I think it's for my 11th birthday I got a pet snake and it was this exact snake and it's a Nelson's milk snake so I was like loving the bag looking at it I do I do it not and then I was like oh wait that's my boy that's my pet snake of course I have to get in so this is pretty sentimental to me this is my boy this is my first proper my childhood pet but when I was younger I had to stick insects and guinea pigs and stuff like that but this snake this snake was like my responsibility it was the first animal that I properly had to like clean out myself I had to feed myself I had death I'd look after him he was my boy so now I've got him I've got him on my bag which makes me so happy anyways need to get to town what closes so let's get going well this was good great idea after you'd not bring a jumper I found a black hoodie and it's not waterproof but it's gonna have to do I'm not going to let this affect my mood I'm in a bloomin good mood probably shouldn't have worn dung the reason without about either they like telling myself it down or just trying to mess up at all did you hear that got no socks on as well we're going to stay in a good mood everybody so the reason why I'm actually heading into town is obviously to fix my phone as you saw and I've also just hot spotted my phone and uploaded my vlog as well whilst I was here but I'm currently off now to try and buy some microphones for a new series on my pointless blog channel that I want to do I've been looking at this one particular brand of microphones oh sorry for a while now and I've been proper researching into the market and what's good and what's not good to

nice shallow drawers a moment I have my makeup stored somewhere else I'm actually gonna have a nice big round mirror above it as well which I think looks so pretty goes really nicely with my little gray Sewell I do actually have a pink chair which i think is maybe going to go in this gap so this will like move up and then there's going to be a pink chair their pictures downstairs at the moment so I'm going to show you that so this is my pink chair ignore its little got little hooves at the moment and are protecting it from the stool or protecting my floor from it local just pop this down here also we're trying to get the chest of drawers upstairs so pretty and pink look quite nicely actually my bone of the world luckily it's not very heavy also getting this up there's no problem that now I need to get back to my work because I've been shooting these flowers this morning and if she pees I'm going to shoot them somewhere else as well so I have like optioned and then I think about

shovel this in and make space for all of it so yummy no Allah nails bakery super yummy know that to a mountainful and now I'm going to take josh to a Twix favorite in stores just just on the corner so this is where we're going I'm obsessed casually walking along with the cactus you get that I'm great I'm such a child but that cactus makes me laugh so much it's like a penis flown shot so yeah we're done home shopping now goodbye too much no I felt like a 1point oh girl come out with the entire shot at home I'm sick of this very vanilla please thank you do you like the new chair can I keep I don't know if it's going to stay this way but we still look cute together I think this chair will just roam around the office and this might go in the middle I think by the way this is from H&M home super cute I love it I have like a handmade big files like it downstairs from like a little store and Brighton but if you want something similar hmm do this and I think it's really cute so I'm about to go to my mum's in a minute before I do I thought I'd show you my Chop Shop order yeah I mentioned this yesterday I'm going to open up maybe try a couple of bits on see how it is and then I'm going to go just like channel my mom's because I'm feeling really rough also guys my phone is going crazy with new notifications from my home Instagram I thought that I'd show you it thank you to everyone who has liked and commented so far this is my home Instagram had October at home I just started using a hashtag for this for my home stuff and then I realized I wanted somewhere to put all of my home stuff and for now and in the future so I've just posted like five so far this afternoon and you guys seem to really be like now it is so cool and it's also going to be like in stories of home stuff things like that on here that I won't show yet on my hello October XO page so yeah they'll be like into the stories and stuff of like new things before I post them or before you see the member logs yeah that is it go check it out okay so these are the items I bought I have to say on first impressions I haven't tried them on yet obviously but the material isn't the nicest feeling material it's not bad but it's not amazing and the prices are they're not expensive but I do feel like I don't know the material is kind of strange I'll see what it's like on it might be amazing and like full really nicely so we shall see I've got a dress in the screen print and then shorts I think it shorts or a skirt and an off shoulder top and then this pink skirt which I really like I'm hoping this looks good on because I really think it's cute and then it's got like a corset style top which I don't know if that's going to work for me but we will see expo skirt and then I brought this skirt as well I really like the print of it so I didn't like the top version of it by ordered this just because I think I will really like this and get a lot of wear out of it but and yeah I'm not going to keep all of this but I just wanted to try it all on and see it all looks really interesting so these are the cute little these are actually shorts I can remember for shorts or a skirt it shorts and I really like the print of these so cute and all that keeps dropping out I see I really like these I'm probably keep them they're a really nice fit they're just like perfect just absolute perfect oh my gosh I really like the pink skirt is so cute tennis it's a bit too much like other ruffles too much I like the cut of it at the bottom I think it's really flattering I think it's one of those things that might only work in the summer so I don't know I need to think about how much wear out that I will get over the next few summers but so pretty okay pink top Bab fit it's like in my size around the waist around here it's absolutely massive don't love this one so much so this dress is kind of hilarious because I think that's just a bit too much material definitely say if you want this size down so I probably need an 8 in this because it's really wide definitely size down if you're looking to get this if I like the frills that run all the way down the sleeves are kind of weird so really like the shorts of these I really like the print I think it's really nice I'm not entirely sure on this top in fact I don't think I like this top this is what I talk about when I say that shoulder can make you look so much wider I don't love this so don't listen so it's got a really cheap feeling big zip at the back kind of like what they've put on Swim's Douglas because of the material this no saying it's weird it means that these just get stuck then like sit in weird positions like that I don't have time for that good morning it is Sunday I am just great I can't speak this morning and that's great for breakfast with Carly and Leon so I take you with me and wrap up this log because I feel like it's been going off about a week now and it's getting crazy just free thing that I was with Carly and Leon hi guys I am back home now we are us go out for lunch with Josh's family so I'm probably get into vlog here because I also want to start another book I'm going to do an outfits of the week so a bit like my what I eat in a week video I'm going to do or what I wore in a week starting from today so I'm not going to show you too much of my outfit and I'm going to start doing that now and I'll get so confused if I try and do two at a time I'm just going to do that and yeah if you guys have enjoyed this week's vlog part of its Braddock I feel like I've mentally been a bit all over the place

forward to it but thank you so much for watching I love you lots can I switch you can see bye"	3035

and I've been really enjoying it and being able to get ahead but sometimes I'll put one up and Thursday I was finding that my videos on Thursday weren't getting very good views and when you put so

digestives and rich tea because last time I got rich tea this time we got there Justin and they're just not as good as rich tea so if anyone could tell me what the differences in terms of ingredients and how bad they offer you because I'd say you've made a hand gesture means anything what the rich to you better how healthy difference no I think that they're equally taste great but you have two issues one logistics see wise oh these are a bit more like fillings no in terms of dipping oh it's got the wonder if you shouldn't sketch okay so PA k was rich to Swan dips because it should be quick oh yeah for they my foot apart yes is the risk you ever they go hit me again yeah so let's change which to Zeke was one digested weekly dipping but Ricky's taste better it made neither makeshift bed

and before I finish my makeup and do my mascara I wanted to show you guys this mascara because I'm loving it at the moment it's the Estee Lauder sumptuous knockout for so I love the packaging as I waited and amazing but this is so good for days where you want slightly more natural lashes but they really define and make them really long let me see if I can show you the brush this is the brush so it's like one of those plasticky ones but it's so so good I love it I'm wearing Clinique lipliner in intense blush which is really nice contra see in this light you see better now I'm gonna clap my

after that for lunch was delicious and now going to head to Liberty I go her some Rococo chocolate almonds because she loves almonds and back at my parents house now and apparently my mom said I've got loads of clothes left in this room I feel like if I haven't worn them by now they're probably not clothes I miss that much so I'm gonna quickly go through them and just check there's nothing I want before she gets rid of them think they're in here oh god this is all like random summer clothes I was looking for this Lakers top okay I'm gonna go through all of this now and see if there's anything that I actually want Harden in shorts turns out there's not much stuff I actually want from that top drawer a few things here that I'm taking second drawer done absolutely nothing kept this is all like nice stuff but I just don't wear anymore so that my sisters and my cousin literate and then everything else go into the charity shop just checking out my mom's handbag collection she actually uses this to hang her handbags on the back of her door in some urban outfits as I actually ordered it to use in my bathroom but I found that you couldn't close the door because it's like this but she never closes a virgin door anyway so she uses this to hang all her bags which I think looks pretty cool I don't know if I've ever shown you guys these photos of my parents house of like our family I feel like I haven't really even acknowledged that these are here I always forget but there's some really good wedding photos and now I'm getting married I look at them in a whole different light these are Mike this is my dad's mom and dads my grandparents neither of them are alive anymore but how amazing is this photo look at her wedding dress and the guys flowers I mean that is super posh and then this is mom is this your aunt no that's my dense that's my dad that's that's my grandpa he's no longer alive so that's my grandpa and his sisters that's my grandpa's mom my greatgrandmother they make you doubt the whisper they made all their clothes themselves apparently I mean look how cute my grandpa is but it's so sweet looks bit like ASA looks a lot like a so actually yes if I look at his hats to go her oops not focusing okay and then I have no idea who all these other people are that's my grandma's dad so my great grandpa that honey hardy see how do you end up with these photos mom god this one pops who pops mom so my grandpa's mom and dad my greatgrandparents that was my grandpa looking very dapper and this is one of my favorite photos ever that's my grandma my grandpa my grandpa is wearing a swimming costume I mean that's obviously the style what was this like 40s 30s I mean look how cool that is as the best photo ever I just got home to a ticket it's a parent I drove into the congestion zone when I really didn't realize they had it's really not clear if your car should look beep or something so now I owe 65 pounds and if I don't pay it within 14 days it goes up to 195 pounds did I did it affect anyone by going looking just Josh did I hire anyone yeah congestion did I congest anyone their friends just said do you want some Nutella yes I do this is that cable that will make you feel better it's quarter to five now and we're going out at 7:00 tonight at Carly balls wash my hair it's only friends so I'll just do that tomorrow but I think I'm going to use the next couple of hours to sort out my wardrobe because I've been buying loads of new things recently actually I'll show you guys because I will show you these are the culottes I bought from Topshop the other day very scary purchase but I liked them and then actually I think you saw the other things that I bought yesterday but with all these nice new things I feel like my wardrobe is just a bit like they're not I want it just be beautiful so I'm going to sort through my wardrobe because I like to do that every now and again and just throw away or not throw away but give to charity and sisters and friends stuff that I'm not wearing anymore I don't know why I'm choosing to do it now but I fancy doing it now I might get bored halfway through but first thing I'm going to do is uncheck onto my bed because this is the stuff that I never touch and so I feel like if it's sitting under here it's not getting worn so I'm going to go through my shoes and I'm going to go through all of this rubbish here and sort out I've got some really thin strappy summer tops I think I still like in the summer so I'm going to keep them and I've got Christmas jumpers I loved this one this year I don't want to get rid of it I think I might still like it next year and Rich's Christmas jumpers here as well so I think want to keep these I think it's a bit of a habit of mine to hold fancy dress things like these Minnie Mouse ears or this bandanna and disco pants that I never wear I think it's like the uni girl in me that thinks oh I might need this for fancy dress I don't even remember the last time I went to a fancy dress party but it is very annoying when you get invited to like a Disney themed party or a pirate party and you think oh I really should have kept those Minnie Mouse ears or bandanna so I'm going to keep them oh my gosh I'm so happy I found this and I was talking recently about how she is kept or her like important clothing items throughout the years so like the dress she wore to her music starts all the gesture was a graduation I was like all that centralised thing to do I should have done that this is the dress I wore to graduation so I obviously did do that as well I just forgot so this is a Topshop dress size 12 haven't changed good good to know Silla size 12 yeah this is the dress I wore to my graduation and it's like white and floaty I actually still like it I would still wear it but I'm gonna keep this just in case my daughter thinks like oh I want to see what you watch your graduation it was a big day I was very proud of myself so I will this with black tights and heels yeah I'm doing well so far this is rich si he's got a few pairs of shoes and some like sporty clothes and socks and stuff and then he's got a big bag it's gonna go there and then these are my summer clothes that it's just for like when it's really hot and when I go away Christmas jumpers there I'm going to go through these shoes in a minute and then I've just kind of got like Travel packing bags to fit in I think I've shown you this before but I like to take pearloid pictures of the shoes that are in the box I don't know if I'll keep updating this as the shoes change but for now it kind of works I just slip it there and then when I put the shoe box over there I can see what's in it I realized that I wasn't really wearing the shoes in the box so what I've done is put in like my summer sandals and stuff in the box but my other shoes I've just laid out like this so I can easily grab I need I've got my Topshop boots my Steve Madden boots my June boots most Madden's whistles shoes Topshop peels off its shoes and converse and then there's a few trainers in the other room okay I think that's pretty much done I just need to put my camera bag on top of Rich's bag there this is all the stuff that I'm going to get rid of or give away these shoes I didn't end up wearing them as much as I thought I would but you know that happens someone else will enjoy them I'm sure and some damn shorts and other stuff that doesn't fit me just sorting out my wardrobe so I've done all of these things that hanging checks all those clothes and I don't want to do this jumper I love that this is hungry but I never wear it because it's so high net and tight around the neck and like huge on the arms most unflattering thing ever so I don't actually wear it so I think I'm going to have to get rid of it this is also one of those items I'm going to try and keep because this finally enough was a tshirt I was wearing on the day that rich proposed to me Miki's burgers tshirt so whenever I wear it I normally to wear home because it's kind of scruffy I just think Oh memories so try to keep this one as well this is my entire jeans collection I have two pairs of black Jamie jeans exactly the same but I just wear them so often is worth having two and then one pair of black Jamie jeans have rips in them that are more faded then I've got some river Ireland I think they're called Ashley jeans and my new a sauce like boyfriend jeans and then I've got a pair of just blue Jamie jeans and another pair of blue Jamie genes that have rips in them so kind of one of every type of jean that you'll need really this is all the stuff I'm going to give away I think I've done really well because I thought that all the stuff I had in my flat as opposed to my parents place was all like new good stuff but really I just don't wear some of these things ever even though they might some of them might be quite new I just feel that there's no point having them cluttering up space someone else could enjoy them instead okay I'm ready to go out I am way my ripped Jamie jeans and the new top that I got from Urban Outfitters I love this really amazing something from the white company it's all nice lunch in comfy I actually got it in the small and never small on anything so we're boob has nice pockets I'm wearing this really pretty whistles necklace which has like marble detail on it and that that's all really I don't know how much tonight I'll vlog because I don't want to be that friend that's like filming when we all just want to chill but saying that it's Debs in Poland jammer and Ben who love being on camera and a very relaxed but whole vlogging thing so if I remember to vlog oh well if I'm just having too much of a good time then I probably won't but we're not ending yet so don't worry we're having to bring a chair to Penn and Gemma's for dinner small flat problems when you don't have enough chairs for your guests we

"no_DAILY VLOG  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DIE....txt"	"good morning everybody it's cold now isn't it last night I slept with my summer duvet oh and I think it might be the last night I do so there's all the dogs to go out remember we could go next you go I think it might be the last night I do that because I woke up this morning really really chilly and had a nice hot shower to walk me through but then you get out of the shower and it's cold anyway I just got back from New York like yesterday so my body cocks a bit alone but and I feel like I start all my video not less at the moment so I apologize for that but I have been traveling quite a lot and I already vlog oh she's doing to play go on mate really good girl that's funny I feel like I only film at them when fun things we've got a new vlog on when I'm doing fun things it just so happens I'm travelling quite a bit and you know it happens anyway today's quite good one I think I believe I'm hosting the live show for the Tommy Hilfiger fashion show so something I figure usually showed in New York which is where he's got that from but for the past time I'm showing in London and they'll ask me to do their live show for them but that was the last I heard so it's all quite last minute of that a lot a few days ago and obviously I haven't it's been the weekend and I've been traveling so I don't really know what's going on I'm going in for a fitting now to get clothes sorted for the show and I believe I'm running that fashion show but I don't know that is on Instagram on Facebook on some other thing I don't know really what my role is it's all quite up in the air but I'm just looseygoosey about it I'm gonna turn up and do I have to do but it should be a good day so come on her stop is the fitting then I've got kind of a lot of time to kill and I'm going to stay in the office in London because I know that if I come back here the temptation will be just too sore to have a sleep or something so no work in the office have a catch up with everyone and then I've got the show later or I mean I that might not be the case I might go to the office to find out got loads of rehearsals and thinks oh well wing it shall we let's do it okeydokey I finished my meeting now fully intended to go in and film it for you so you can see a bit of behind the scenes stuff but actually it wasn't like my normal fittings typically what happens is you go into a store and then you meet someone there hey would you fancy and they give you put things on you you try and things are nearly picks that other you like they'll go pins in your if you need to be altered at all that sort of stuff this is very different it was actually full of people because it shows that she today places today that haven't got time to mess around with things so you in and out there's a bunch of you I bumped into Marcus and Steffi there because Stephanie's going to the show and basically this is a bunch of rails and you just pick things put them on they go okay cool off you go so I call it though the theme of the show I should know much about the show you I'm finding it all that out later but it seems from I saw clunky rock and roll so yeah my looks quite cool actually then I saw my clean drop off my bag and now I have to go and get breakfast and I'm me and yet and it's time is now nearly midday so I'm starving and also I need to find a little learn adapt to do that because I put my camera with me and why not we've made both my videos to edit from when I was in New York a few days ago but I haven't got the thing to get my memory card from my camera I'm doing just looked into the office and look what I can see and I come close so tell if you see it in the comments yeah there is so exciting apparently I've just been told that a big bundle has arrived today so Hugh loads of selfies of me like this rolled on books I bring breakfast she's not even breakfast because is they stopped serving breakfast is late now my fish finger wrap from Leon which is amazing and then a curry which is not breakfast food but you know I'm a bloody babylon sighs there is today I look so these ones are paperbacks I have to be honest I've even though I was doing paperbacks no one tells me nothing so that's cool and in here I think we have the hard bucks let's open this bad boy up without like damaging the book oh I did not push anyone near hard enough then okay go again round two it's not working the blunt is not ever come on hand it's not easy to vlog and do this sort of thing there we go these are the hard facts oh why do I have news about one of the signings the Glasgow signing a lot of people had email yesterday saying that it was cancelled it's not cancelled but the venue has changed I don't reassure what happened if some reason the venue has change so check your emails if you want a ticket to the Glasgow ones I think unfortunately no it's really annoying but talking about my hand you might have to repurchase it tickets for the new venue and I think it's only around the corner I don't know what happened but that's that's kind of the situation so if you've got an email saying is cancelled don't panic just redo it sorry for inconvenience but they'll be good promise current you're playing a game of booked Jenga or listen guys it took me here to write this a don't damage a single copy Millie that is reckless look no you're good you're off yeah I know but no look at this look at it wobble I will get you fired oh my god the whole thing just tilted how many more other I need one in my hand I think this photo I know Wow I feel like I hope over in this it may as well go all in right it's all the books excellent I need one copy for to hold but otherwise sterling job guys I check him doubt about a half way I was adding them and I don't be part of it after that because I thought if I damage my own books where he's had is if you got goodies in my peer box so let's have a look through and see what's going on so here I have Jamie on his new book along with some olive oil and gave me apparently this also came with a bunch of perishables but I was in New York so merely took them and used the recipe that came with it and said it was delicious it's like a cause Yeti pesto past the time thing I think but you said it was great so many liked it is good enough for me so thank you very much Jamie I'm here I'm not sure what this is this is called Newt drew of vitality and there gave him a couple of things and I think it just mix them with water I want to say so I've got a boost and I've got an immune support that's the line that's raspberry this one is nutria protect be vitamin need to protect be vitamin formula for the reduction of tiredness and fatigue I could do that today I'm very tired today and this one is for immune system that's cool thanks very much I'll be trying them out I got some mr. naughty stuff here they've got like a selection of bits and bobs so I've got a bit of shave oil so basically when I skate I kind of do the around my neck here and then you know the bits were it's a bit sparse but because I don't want use it like a shaving foam for that because you kind of can't see where you're shaving I want something that's transparent so and oil is really good and also a beard elixir which is like a beard oil that you put on and keep on I think and some beard soap so my beer is gonna be tiptop condition and then this looks like fun so this came from who this big potato and it says basically answer a question and then take a layer off after you are these questions so what color is the lid of a Marmite jar yellow I'll open it I'll come back to you tons of that we've got yellow paper and it says what color isn't oompa loompa ok orange with green hair I hate green with orange hair I think the orange with green hair unless a orange they're orange now what colors are baby swans I figured they were just white like adults ones but maybe not Ugly Duckling or some like was it but that's a duck I don't know turns out they're gray now what color it's the special ice cream green now you can know how to pick color brain enjoy okay I'm intrigued so this is color brain which I'm assuming is like a board game or something two players or two to twenty players fourteen plus twenty minutes to play add some color to your quiz how do you judge up a brand new clear simple give everyone the answers before they start and make them all colors something with eleven colored cards in your hand play the right ones to answer our crafty questions and watch your points come rolling and I see okay so all the questions will be like here are so that's fun maybe I'll play that along with a few friends and maybe a few Jin's still in the office I've come to the PIO box room look behind me just for a change of scenery she had a meeting just then and totally forgot to hit my camera as I read the pressing meeting because I was meeting with someone about a will so I wouldn't see my counter like a month or two months ago and they said to me I would put your wheel sorted I was like well no like time 29 I don't need a wheel I'm not gonna die anytime soon but they stressed the importance of me getting one just in case the worst happens apparently it can be quite a long drawnout long drawnout process for town or my siblings or you know whatever to get to get the money from my death basically so I had a wheel sorted and this is a really sad conversation of talking about what happens at and died before me but I'm still I die before her what has we died at the same time like a pain crash or a car crash or something what happens we've got kids and we'll die at the same time this is a really depressing chat but my will is well on the way to being done I've had a chap told her what I want to happen and now I just have to kind of get all written up and sign it and then just wait to die space yeah anyway I forgot to take my camera mode was for the best because a bit sad and now I just kind of come in here cuz there's nothing cool in here often when you first walk into gleam it's so hot because it's quite chilly outside and you can't you know you get your blood pumping and stuff you come from the office is boiling so in here we've got this big old machine behind me which pumps out cold air and the aircon so I'm just gonna cool for a minute and then go back to work the lifts always got very dark or very not going to lift and now the nerves start kicking because I'm doing the live thing I've actually got no one witness I'm not sure about to film anything I might be able to get to you here and there but you sure but someone who comes with me on these things who can you know take the camera but I'm going totally solo so hopefully I'll see you at some point Wow look at a queue to get in doesn't even start it yet it's not for a while yet blimey okay I don't know where I go very well but it's it's getting busy in the other room behind me is acting I think about something like a stream through I'm going to do my life speak now tell me now if I said earlier big circles look around apparently you're a fag or having my seat so I came in through a there I think I need to go to I'll check it out from up top so there's gonna be a crazy show fear in our waters can we mental oh god my house is a mess hey puppy Oh buy them come on come see me come on there you go come on up here good girl hi baby hi so my house had a mess because I had a bunch of stuff in the office when I was in the office earlier today but I went straight from the office to

"no_DAY IN THE LIFE  MOVING VLOG #5.txt"	"good morning angels like a map to my youtube channel I'm feeling really tired today I don't really know why boo I think it's because everything from the last how many days four or five days or just completely hit me because this morning I've just been doing loads of admin work and stuff from sorting out the internet so like you know boring sitdown things I just think it's the first time I'm actually been able to sit down properly and not relax but you know just think relaxing my body in a few days and it's just I'm just exhausted a room sudden today's plan actually let me see you down because my back's within me I'm over the last week I've literally like developed the body of a grandma or if my face is a bit shiny why apologizing my face is shiny Eddie sometimes your face gets shiny ain't nothing wrong with that babe I put on some of that Rimmel tinted moisturizer and some days it can just make you look like a million bucks in other days it doesn't really much feel complexion but we all know what they say boo I am the glow queen I am today it's just about doing all of the things me and Connor have not been giving ourselves the time to do for example the food shop oh we had to eat fried mat we had a Domino's well Saturday night we got like an Indian takeaway box from Asda you know those meals that you can get it was like eight pounds for two booths so good Sunday night we got McDonald's I think and then yesterday night which was Monday night we went out to dinner with my family so we have not been eating fresh and my diet is in really poor a week or two before we actually moved I was giving go free eating a go and I did really enjoy it but I just feel like I need to be in the right mindset to be doing that and right now I just feel like my head is kind of all over the place so I'd rather not restrict myself with any dietary requirements just while I'm getting myself settled into this place we'll probably return to being day free well I'm one of my life just calms down to be honest so yeah today when you to a food shop I need to go and get some boring things like coat racks etc I'm going to try and give myself like a few hours to try my luck this afternoon and just chill out yeah so the internet the internet is finally finally finally being done after days of trying to sort it all out the people at virgin have been really really good and someone should be coming out either today or tomorrow I the internet so that I've been like the enemies of videos up it's taken hours and hours and hours to get them up like literally about eight to nine hours which is just unheard of for me I usually got my videos up with the sword like twenty thirty minutes so when they come hopefully my videos can be up a lot quicker I have a boring day but I just thought it bit the camera can Rob because I know you guys love these sort videos you know so I had loads of really good suggestions for our bedroom I cannot wait to get this sorted I want to get some blinds why can't I get blinds from you guys I know that don't album do some good ones like sixteen pounds which I think I'm gonna get I'm gonna pop out to the shops now in a minute anyway so I'm gonna see if they have any cuz I would love to just have them now you know what I mean is anybody else like that I'm so impatient when it comes to online shopping the nearest on Elm is back in Bristol which is about an hour away for us now I haven't really got a time to go to Bristol just to get a bloody pair of lines you know I mean so when I go out to the shops and see if I have any that I can actually buy in person and bring it back to my flat to put in my window that was very expression eeww and I think here I'm gonna get an ottoman or something or a chez lounge however on earth you say that may be getting nice rug and I want to get a little table for that this corner is giving me grief it's very big it's very spacious look how many steps you can see my feet look how many steps I can do a lot that is gonna be the dedicated Christmas corner and nothing is gonna stop me from putting my Christmas tree there literally I can't wait for that to be full of a Christmas tree December the 1st probably even earlier than that Who am I kidding this face I think I want to put a little desk or something I know we have the big desk in the beauty room but no a little desk maybe sit down the cow at the lovely High Street still obsessing over my dicenio frames fuck wait for my dining chance to come I think they're coming tomorrow oh my god which totally reminds many to check my post office the post office my post box run your stage that this one knows like uhhuh well nothing getting any posts no like have you been checking the post box and I was like no boo that's why anyway so I'm gonna wrap the shops now get a few bits and bobs but if I'm actually gonna show you because I'm actually gonna film them as like cool videos like I'm gonna do a pile and holding there autum home or i just feel like i'm i really am i overstepping the limit with this i feel like this is too random of an outfit you know I mean sliders cropped leggings from Primark good evening from misguided and then the posh handbag I can't redo this can i what should I eliminate though that's the question definitely not ready to say goodbye to sliders just yet I'm just not boo don't we have any other bags no maybe if I popped some longer leggings on with my trainers that might be a bit better I dare oh look there is everywhere you go oh my god it was so funny the guy that delivered this mirror was like why do you have so many mirrors in your house and I was like sorry sorry and he was like yeah look you have a mirror there you've got a mirror there heels like you obviously just love looking yourself I was like huh call me I feel like that is a bit better you know I refuse to take this off this is my new favorite and I generally have an option but to not change my bag to be honest let's just hope I don't bump into anybody I know I'll run to the post office because I'm taking back some horrible buddy remember that awful jumper dress I got in my car if you watch the hall you'll know depop liveries yeah that all for tuning dress keys welcoming keys yes this is the biggest problem I found what a great angle but boo I'm gonna tell you anyway they're just like the biggest issue I've found with having my own place always like I've got my keys I've got my keys cuz I'm mad indifferent to have my keys spare keys I'm gonna get some spare keys cut good idea boo good idea see sometimes talking to a camera like a Kelowna tick actually it's okay because you speak a little my pass yes my pass have a got my phone I think so okay guys so when to the shops came

"no_DECLUTTERING + MY PIERCINGS  Weekly Vlog #19.txt"	"morning welcome to another weekly vlog I am just on my way to my parents house driving there when I help my dad with the food shop because it's always more fun when you do the future with someone else isn't it and then I think my mom wants a trip to dine out as well and I really want to go because I just love her my stuff so I'm gonna go with her then I want to go home and declutter that is a plan for Saturday today doing the future I always accidentally make my way to the hope not it's September and there's already minutes of highways look this is dangerous I don't think I've ever had serene before but they've got banana Li which sounds great so I'm going to try that for breakfast oh I imagine that would be quite nice ooh some bananas and we cure something toasted so I just come back home for a bit I wanted to drop my shopping off I've got a couple of bits for the week and I also want to declutter some bits as well but I think I'm gonna drive back to my parents later and we can go to the cinema to see it I ended up getting some cooking stuff as well I got some toffee cake mix and you can even make cake or cupcakes or muffins I've got a salted caramel cake mix as well I'm gonna do some baking you know bake off season I want to bake more I've got some of my favorite rice kitchen roll loads of peppermint tea I have like a peppermint tea every night before bed because it helps me feel nice and ready for better some more of my favorite coffee I love this stuff it's so good I got this as I showed you earlier Hobnobs as I showed you earlier this week is another one of those really really busy weeks so I didn't need much I just want a few like quick things for lunches and stuff so I thought some sausage ravioli a mushroom tortellini and I also got some mushroom sauce cuz I didn't want to buy any like vegetables or stuff because I'm going away and great Anita yeah this way and then upset to my room I want to declutter my jeans so I'm going on holiday on Saturday and I'm just trying to try and pick some bits to take with me I'm going to Marrakech so I'm very aware I've been there before that you need to cover your shoulders and your knees I think as well just trying to put some outfits together now and get them up my wardrobe if you watched my last vlog then you would have seen that I bought some bits from machine or sheet in and these are actually perfect for Marrakech because they're likely to like lacy cardigans with a little tie on them and they're just great because you can add them over anything to cover yourself up a bit so I've got that then I've got a couple here as well and I love them I think they're great so I'm gonna be taking some of these just to throw on over kind of everything else I'm wearing especially if I'm leaving the hotel I don't plan on leaving the hotel much I've done all the touristy stuff in Marrakech before and I'm really just using this as an excuse to leave the country read lots of books eat lots of good food get a little bit of Sun OspA the Sun for a year and and take some nice pictures as well this one is so pretty it's kind of embroidered like floral pattern on it I will leave links to some of these down below if any of you are interested okay this is my Jean draw these little ones I own I also have my buck pair which are in the wash and I'm wearing out which I am definitely keeping so I've worn these and not stopped since getting them but there's a lot of these I don't wear anymore so I'm just gonna go through them I'm gonna try some of them on and then choose what ones to keep and what ones do the pot on do you pop or give to charity okay so this is why it's a great idea to go through your clothes frequently and try things on because I forgot how much I loved these these also from Topshop they're Lee jeans I didn't like the pattern of them when they were kind of sitting in the drawer but now I've tried them on especially with this top as well I think they look really cool so I'm definitely keeping these and now that I remembered that I've got them I'm definitely gonna wear them often I'm not sure about these they're from new look I haven't worn them in about a year I really like them I like the color but they're a little bit too pale I think I feel like they're not the most flattering so I might put these on my Deepak along with these ones he's a Topshop Pippa jeans petites they're really nice again but I just don't ever wear them so they'll go to a better home he's like the only pair of like smart smart ish trousers I've got one of the only pairs anyway did see something really similar to this Bershka in west from Stratford and they were a lot more cropped like I've rolled these up quite a lot because I'm obviously very short and so I might actually each I've had these for so long they're from via here and they're like kind of bubbling a little bit you can kind of see it's kind of bubbling so I might give this shoe charity shop and to go and pick those ones up in stage because they weren't too expensive but they fit really nicely and they're a little bit more like yeah cropped and fitted okay and these are the only pair of like leather look trousers I own they're from River Island and I never wear them I don't think I've worn them out once but because they're the only ones I have I'm hesitant to get rid of them just in case I think they'd look really nice with some heels under blouse so I might put them in my maybe pile and if I don't wear them this winter they don't know it's time to put them on default okay so this is my trouser draw now I have two smart pairs of trousers hanging up in my wardrobe I need to these hangers out if anyone remembers my Fiat video then I've got these they're like a duck egg blue really skinny cropped trouser and I got them in black as well so I keep those hanging up because they they're smart ones they need to be hung up these are my shorts I've got some leggings someone who try and declutter these as well I'd be great if they could all fit into one drawer let's see how I really love these shorts so so much they're from Primark and I got them like a year ago now but I don't if you can see that but they are very baggy on me now I lost a lot of weight after my breakup I think like a stone in total and which is such a shame because I absolutely love these but like they're absolutely massive on me but I'm gonna keep them anyway cuz I've got loads of boats I can like finish them in a bit with oh okay so I put shorts in here Imogene straw and I've got leggings and baggy pants I soft as well in here so I've got a little bit room and these are the stuff and getting rid of has anyone got any ideas of how to get rid of bubblin I mean I'm just gonna chuck these anyway because I can't wear them these are like my circus pants the one the leggings that I wear when I do circus which starts to give me sweet I'm so excited I'm gonna chuck those but if anyone knows how to get rid of bubbling that'd be greatly appreciated I'm gonna crack on I'm gonna keep it coming keep on going I'm gonna keep on going what I really need is like a box that I put summer stuff in because a lot of these shorts I'm not gonna wear in the winter so be good to have like a box under my bed of stuff that I wear in the summer okay hey this mess of a draw is my workout slash pajamas kind of apart from this I don't know why that's in there I would like to not have it at all but I don't have anywhere else to store place it's just a shame cuz all my other drawers are nice and neat this one's just mess so I'm gonna go through this now I definitely don't need all these pajamas or workout clothes but I do know like a lot of these tshirts I don't want to get rid because I absolutely loved they were like band tshirts I'd like it to fit in this space but I don't think that's gonna happen lies I just got really distracted I came down to make myself a drink and ended up baking cookies it's Sunday it's also oh wow oh God the annoying thing is I didn't even get myself a drink in the end do so I'm gonna get more now oh maybe I have a cup of tea cup of tea with my cookies yours well look at this isn't this delicious I'm using my news weather mug it's great sighs so cute okay we are done shorts leggings sports leggings band tshirts for gym more leggings and crop tops and shorts see yeah that's good so now I have this draw spare I think I might do pajamas and like bras because that moment my bras on my knickers are in

Superstar at the regents park open air theater and I fell in love it was just so simple but so beautiful that the song just came alive more and I absolutely loved it so it was the third time I saw it last night with my mom and sister they both loved it too and it's closing soon if you have a chance please go and see it before it ends because it's just incredible it's got like a real rock vibe to it the choreography is just incredible it's very like contemporary and my favorite thing about it is instead of blood they use glitter so it's beautiful to watch it was glitter everywhere that was good let me sit down why am i standing so it's I make mid today and I have some events today I'm going to the glamorous showroom to see some of their new autumn/winter pieces I think and then I'm to

"no_DELILAH'S NAMING  VLUNE.txt"	"hey guys I thought I should start the blog now before it gets even more hectic and I don't chance to intro the blog properly so today is delayed Jelena's kind of get my child's name right today is the liners naming ceremony I'm eager to just get like stuff sorted and set out and decorations up and then I'll start with a little bit more relaxed there's just so much to do and I'm like I want to get in order and do it all three up since 6 I actually set my alarm and go up about 40 minutes before Delilah did so I could curl my hair and you're probably thinking Rhiannon where's the two dresses you were trying to decide for well I know I was try and pick between these two dresses I was trying them on last night and the blue one I love but it's just not I mean I know this one's not particularly fancy it's still quite casual but like I don't feel that comfortable in it the other one from Topshop I love really wanted to wear but why not and funding issues that really went well with it but the main thing is that I would have to like really pin myself into it and that would make it quite uncomfortable for me to get one get the hall ready lift boxes cook stuff whatever and two I would have to start uncomfortable at constantly rearranging myself or I could have Ward's make comfortable to get the party stuff ready and then I could have got trade changed into that but they would have events but at the venue there's no mirrors or anything to get I'm changing so I would not be able to pay myself in properly and it just would have been more hassle so I feel really comfortable in this dress I do like this dress is the dress I wore it in the last vlog actually so it kind of feels like I've worn it pretty much for the last like four days um but I do love it I just think it really suits me and it comfortable and it's by the same Ralph Lauren brand that the blue dress is from and guys look look it has pockets and I really like the dress like this leaves us slightly flared and it's just lovely color like babydoll spot smokes all dress and I feel like this does go with my boots so I'm wearing this today I've called my hair's made feel a little bit nicer and that's gonna have to do by dog's been getting stuff in the car and if you're wondering why Delilah is she's at her grandparents they're being absolute gems and lookin after Delilah for the morning so we can get everything sorted I know I'm for 100 miles an hour it's just you've got a lot to do we need to get in the car now cuz I'm pretty sure we're behind schedule already so I catch up with you guys at the venue and because I think dogs pretty much gotten everything from the living room into the car I've just got this big bag here or stuff that I'm gonna tape like my camera my hair colors if my hair needs weakened and later a bit of makeup some of the Leila stuff pretty much it oh and I also need to get these flowers down in the car with me I'll be rid of it screech and yeah it's been flowers yesterday and I've kept them in water and I'm really happy about they're all still alive got some sunflowers and then something new probably a little purple one and wrinkly white why I'm sorry I can't under the names of them this peppery stuff and be that you love these I had to get some and then these gorgeous ones I've discovered some really random colorful dope that kind of work flowers how we do it we did have a flower back but I left a double parent check so I'm just going to put the bottom in this bag just sort of written all over nation so like little country bumpy with my boots and my flowers in my little my little drift so it's going to be fun sit in the car then I always find it through area on a Sunday so she ate this plant about quarter past nine and there's like no one around except a few birth but dog has dropped me off I'm going to run to Starbucks get us both and ice cracking and then he's going to pick me up again and we're going to go to the pink a scientist I mean I've already had a cup of coffee today but I need another another coffee and I will probably need another coffee later to get me through the campaign for the car like Chester can't drive alone and I mean selfdirected study that I called my mom for making our values we respond to her mean at once not met like all our friends other people don't think that combat and athlete guide can throw regulation and I'll see you in six level off and making of well but Rama so terrible our automated effective drugs managed to go past it that's a start and then in Cologne who's all

like chatty and so much and like laughing so much poor rich is hobbling because these hoes back which is not good so I need to look after him and not paint in the flat and shout to him like I just did and also TC gave us an Aston all of London little clutch bag with my initials monogrammed also so nice are you out of the jumper because I can't tell if I'm just really hot or I'm like getting ill because you know you feel like you're like hot from the inside that's how I felt all day I think I just need to take this down for off especially I might to show you what I got today because when I forgot to vlog when I was at Ana I did a little bit of shopping so let me take you into my bedroom okay the first thing I got these sliders from Topshop because I was on a shoot last week and the stylist was wearing them they're only 20 pounds and I just feel really cool and they're really comfortable so I've been wearing those all day okay what's in here the Caroline cleanser yeah I got a couple of things from mango I keep seeing people talk about mango and every time I go in I just think it like all feels a bit cheap to me and I never find anything I like online it looks really nice but I'm just not like massively into online shopping sometimes I am if I like know the brand if it's like a sauce but if it's a brown I don't know I find it quite hard to know what sizing I'm going to be so I went in with Anna I found the really nice stuff there's one on Oxford Street actually it was really good for onch to white dresses I'm going to list for next week so I thought it'd be nice to have some summery dresses this is just number one strappy like thin straps that have to wear strapless bra with it and then buttons all the way down it kind of cinches in at the way so it's got these big pockets and it's kind of MIDI lengths so that was really nice like a nice cotton white dress this one's a little bit seethrough but I sort of so cute it's kind of more like a beachy dress it's off the shoulder kind of a white cotton linen II style with a blue stripe buttons all the way down and it kind of phrase out at the bottom I'm terrible at describing clothes it also has a wrap and I just thought that was nice and summery I also picked these up from at the gleam office they are Libya's kitchen Bicky bombs and I really like them I thought which would like them too although I can feel that they are stuck melted a lot these in the fridge I bought some granny pants from M&S but no seriously I need some nude pants that can go under like these sort of white dresses and not be seen and I find that all the no VPL mrs. Remini it all made out this kind of like light chrome material which I find just gets so sweaty I know that's TMI but they do do cotton knickers in nude and I can't find them anywhere this is like a slightly different materials I thought I'd try these out um so it's got some nude knickers and it will support some some socks this is a swimming question I got from Selfridges I'm so in love with it from a brand called Melissa oughta bash in that please say it with a pound you like the Rolls Royce of swimming costume this is what it looks like it's strapless but I just realize it does come with a strap which is great I didn't realize that it's so soft guys I can't even explain to you I was in earlier I never normally go for strapless but I want to have something a bit different and I thought it was really frustrating actually stays up like perfectly maybe not if I'm like running down the beach but I won't be running down the beach I thought it was really special and as it was a gift I thought why not go to something really nice this is like way more than I would normally spend on a swimming costume so I'm really happy with that that's about it I got said a few things in my peer box I won't go through everything there's a new Knick foundation total control so this parody you can wear it really share or medium or build it up it's like in everything foundation and this some tan luxe it's the Hydra mousse that is a fake tan I don't understand how that's a fake tan mousse I'm so intrigued by this so I definitely want to try that out and that's everything I think I'm going to leave this vlog here again apologies if it's short hopefully it comes out not too short but when you watch this it will be bank holiday weekends I hope you guys have it a really nice time I will see you guys in my next video thanks for watching bye"	2004

greyhounds run around we're gonna put some bets on hopefully win some moolah la bitch better have my money to get a bitch bitches bitch better win me money huh I recently went to a score which was horse racing and it was really fun and I won a lot of money on one horse so I think I've got the magic touch here yeah so I'm expecting a lot of money coming my way the interesting thing is we decided to go this light afternoon like event rather than the night event because it was the only one we could do if boilinghot in Essex right now literally I'm sweating you can see this because we actually like five takes this intro because alex is a mug and also write the people here it's not really the sort of clientele you expect to hang out on Thursday I mean they say the average age is is

hopefully we need some money this guy out the column so hot let's put some money on the dog biscuit and I might just exciting isn't it it's a capacity crowd made no mistake just so they run on sand yeah yeah this is like banging today this is like the time to come I think this is when it's like best atmosphere when it's just empty and it's just us two so it's gonna be a girl right oh I don't hear that said a pin drop okay guys we got her a little bit early basically so we've got a bit of time to kill let me show you how this stuff works so we've got some race is happening today this is the guys on how you can bet on them you can bit a dog to win the race music gotta come first we win no money you can be run into place which means they've got to come first or second I believe yes it does so that's sort of like put your money on yeah you get less money exactly yeah yeah you can bet on like who you think the first free horse first read dog story will be now the individual races we're going to stay for free races today the first one is the 208 these are the dogs let fly demo Borak magic my Valentine little good thing teaching those best time gentlemen which one of them jumps out at you teacher knows best jumps out and makes my mum's a teacher right well teacher knows best form it came second to this last race okay the race before that fifth second no winging it so maybe it's a place could be a good bet I'm thinking I'm gonna go time gentlemen it's got a lot of seconds and thirds I reckon I might go to place on time gentlemen got a question for you Spencer yeah are you picking your whole space in their names or how they placed in the park well I look at the name and now I see other forms like and if it's tennis I come off in the 2:27 for example lady more flyer jumps out on me what's the form like third second second fifth first first not bad bad at all there's no one in the rear jump of the page in terms of in terms of form there so I'll pretty go lady will fly in that one what were you thinking lady McFly folks looser like McFly when I was younger there a boyband from the UK yeah and also the surname of Marty McFly from Back to the Future which is where they buy their name and the final race we're going to do is 247 who are Genesis Artemis we've got mercury magic Selena Mae River vault KH and kuku Kingdom I'm definitely going cougar Kingdom they love the name and look at the form it's won its last two races cougar Kingdom is one for me here you go I'll get on to Bush I make things interesting by copying me by copying maybe you should go from our creamer he's a vaginas Artemis yeah that's a sick name music son party party party Oh tank gun by not so much aquatic is this the best that you've ever gone on so far definitely the top three really are the other two with me or with a colleague on my three dates first three half birthday on his time and all right we've got our bets on five pounds on teacher knows best to win that's my one if I found on time gentlemen to win you're a gentleman no I chose it exactly there in the fifth and sixth language the wider lane so they've got a run round slightly longer route but they could recite their specialists just start it bill ticket and if even then when we go and collect our winnings one of them definitely gonna win on okay how much we're gonna win if one of our things were ever met we put the bet on before they made the optimal break abuse in making the odds now so we did it before we backed ourselves and they face in the name get backfires and therefore you get backfires then we'll waken the odd to the next year race yours is the orange one orange bit far as yours all right mines black and white black and white number six parents it's ours and their friends I think number one that's quite powerful and my next guy ed really skinny you tasted the my side daughter my five six six is done alright sixty leading is going to get skin tired getting tired thanks skin tired okay I was a bike or six I'm on the second six oh six gone five six good well see is another one number one one let flight Damon where does come I think I came second I didn't bet each way I bet to win so Homer yours is my last okay race one is over now I learned something from that because I think I could pick a good dog I mean my dog came second I didn't bet age why I bet to win that's why I didn't win any money forever when the dogs came out I look to them I looked at one I said to you one looks strong yeah who won it strong dog what 1 1 so 1 1 if I wait till the 2nd race and I wait to see the dogs come out I'm gonna look at them again yes have a think about it then the odds also change windows tonight so they would have made one that they pretty made ones odds less good wrong and they saw him yeah we made me move kill Muhammad in my bet you've got a bet to win it with the bookies outside you have to bet to win you can't be age way unfortunately we've got to bet to win yeah so let's put the bet on how they look rather than what they called exactly if they look good and they've got good night that's the dream scenario 3 connection right I've got a bit on the number one called lady McFly three two one five pound on that alex has got fire on inner evil which is number three dog five to one on that there's 25 oh my god if you win it number one this red one here red okay no

good well done fivepound on 15 quid profit fivepound get your stake back to feedback in total which means we're even now for the day's we've done two races we've lost no money get made no money we've made it back here so it's all on the last thing third and last racing about go so let's do some serious homework right now and then just bet it all just hope it just comes in forget it okay first race is over our dogs came second and third so we just missed out the dog that we said looked really good when it came out we wish he came first you should say we said that every single race thank you then by the highway keep probably the doctor would really not want their reallife dogs Ricky going yeah but we have to go bet on the horses people look at us like we don't belong here I think I think we did I think we did I think we do wrong it's a fun date that wasn't it it was actually a really fun day I definitely recommend the dogs for a day it's a little bit different isn't it a bit rough and ready but it's not very glamorous so which would you roll back on your first day would you rather come in when it's busy all alone see like it was today I probably prefer a physics that'd be more atmosphere and yeah you know there was nobody cheering I felt bit silly going come on dogs maybe we should come back another time not in an evening when it's really busy can get the whole atmosphere maybe we're experts in out picking the dogs we know how to do it yeah you mean the bookies no I was talking about maybe this could be a second job for you maybe first I should quit you to become a dog man document horseman you're not horses okay guys that is it for today's alphabet dating episode I hope you've enjoyed it if you have please drop a like on the video subscribe to spend and Alex if

"no_DON'T WATCH THIS DAD..txt"	"oh come on everybody it is a day in June last night I fell asleep on the sofa I woke up about 4:30 at night in the morning sorry it was trying to get light which was terrifying emotional waddle into this bedroom and I've woken up here how the hell did I get here I just have I have no idea how it happened but it has happened plan for today and as you know I have no plans today but I'm gonna vlog it and see what we get to UM but first I need breakfast I always say this but whatever this is obviously a room where I film my videos but this was look this must seem so dodgy to to anyone who stays in this in this bedroom they must get in bed see the camera on the lights in the tripod I just think Joe like always going on what what what what do you do for a job I don't get it right yeah bed son oh oh oh I didn't really work okay so I managed to get from the bed to the floor we're making progress although I have to smash my ass on my bedside table oh where I've kind of like forgotten how to vlog because I've just been for a gym session I didn't actually record any of it which is unusual which you probably shouldn't do anywhere I kind of it weird if ice I think a bit weird if I start film myself in the gym because then you find out how I get so big ah I'm having a bit of a like catch22 with the gym at the moment because I love going and I want to like push myself and work harder with every sort of trip I go to the gym but there's something that's sort of stopping me from doing that and something that's like limiting me to giving it giving it a hundred percent and that is my wrist the wrist is actually holding the camera right now not the wrist but my hand has attached to my wrist that's holding the cam right now um fun little story back in 2010 I went on I went on a lads holiday to Zante in Greece and you know there's like machines you can get where you you punch boxing thing it's like a boxing bag thing you punch and you get a score of how hard you hit it I was read Runk surprised surprised shocked and I hit it but I hit it completely wrong because I was drunk but in all I was doing I swung for it kind of missed it and kind of hit the metal bit behind but hit it very awkwardly and I am now pretty sure I broke my wrist so if you watched my most recent main Channel video eyes and a broken no bones my body I mean it's not confirmed but I am now quite sure that I have actually broken a bone I think I think I've broken my wrist well I think I broke it back in the day at the time it really hurt and if you're drunk and something hurts then you know it's going to hurt twice as much when you're sober if that make sense and I was like oh that didn't feel right that I heard a crack and that feels like it really hurts next morning I couldn't move it so I could not move it like a single bit and it was swollen as hell but we booked a speedboat out for the day I went on a holiday was of us in total 13 young rowdy boys on a speedboat in the middle of the this the I want to say our G&C I don't know one of the seas we all jumped off the boat because we saw an icecream boat floating nearby and I just had to jump off as well forgetting that my risk was in a really bad way and I've been complaining about it well I hadn't been complaining about it but I've been worried about it all morning jumped in the water and then realized that I couldn't swim I couldn't use my right hand to swim so I was trying to swim like frog leg and one arm and I was kind of thinking so I'm at get the ladder in time I had to try and pull myself up using just one hand but when mates find it hilarious and start to keep pushing back into the sea I was a little scared not gonna hide but I made it back with the boat and after that had I still have one of the best days of my life they get me wrong it wasn't was one of the best days of my life why my taint a story again oh yeah because um recently it's been hurting a lot again like really painful like only if I bend it a certain way every now and then it's like seizes up it's always like around this time of year which is when funny enough when I went to Zante a yearly thing it's almost like a reminder of like Joe remembered remember like six years ago and you broke your wrists yeah I remember it because I can still freaking feel it so I might try and book an appointment with the doctors and get it just get it seen to in a sort of light as a peace of mind to know if I actually break it or not cuz I think I think I did break it but I've let natural e heal and obviously it's healed in the wrong way so you might need like Reeb raking and then properly like plastered up and then they make it here in the right way but it might be too late to do that I don't know but either way I've had a bad wrist ever since and it just clicked if I got that this the wrong way it's the other risk by the way and if I do that it clicks all the time is like and it's just it's not good but anyway it affects me in the gym because I can't lift heavy weights if there's certain like exercise that I do which involves you to have good wrist wrist strength and I used to have really good wrist strength not for the reasons you're probably thinking of it was from my old job but uh yeah and now it just seems that is hurting a lot more recently so I might have to go and get it checked out let me know if you broken your wrist in the Khans below and tell me uh or let me know if you've had to have it read broken to make it heal properly let me know if you had anything like that before and tell me how it went because I'm a little bit nervous I'm not gonna lie anyway breakfast time oh I'm officially the worst human being ever I haven't actually done anything I have done stuff but I haven't I haven't had a shower since the gym I haven't actually done anything since gym why I have done Zankou the gym I'm so confused basically I've come back in and I am working on this week's a Sunday special this is a very very special video this Sunday you could even say a little announcement I've been editing it since I got back from the gym and it's currently I think 4 p.m. so basically hours I've been working on and off on it and working on other things as well and so I just complete got to shower or do anything or feed myself I've got a scent like a bag the other day full of like lore'l shower gels and stuff like a rock sack full of it and like things to use in the gym and there's something in there that I'm going to go in attack right now but before I do that I want to show you this look these the two canvases but got they're going to go between these lights and between this lives so quite a while ago I said I was gonna get back into doing art cuz I still didn't already I did art GCSE and alevel and I loved it so I want to get back into it as a little hobby and so I've got my canvases now and I just need to know what to do I know what gonna do one of them I'm gonna get like lots of old I've grown up as well I love the Beano and a dandy so you can get lots of somewhere back home I've got a load of old Beano and dandy comics and I'm gonna turn all up teastained them and stick them and paste them to the canvas so they cover it all in old tea stained be no pages and stuff so that's thing the background of it and then I was really into a stencils and at the whole Banksy thing so I'm going to get like a big stencil cut out I don't know what of yeah and in stencil and spray onto it and then put like thick impasto acrylic paint all over as well and just make it quite 3d and texturized so that's going between you guys and this one I have no idea so you've got any ideas that you want maybe I just just do like I want to do just set up a sharpie to the top left corner and it's let anyone that comes around just draw whatever they want on it like lots different color sharpies and then everyone comes around can sign it or draw a picture on it and the point where is so full anything is a hum humming friends and that's a big old that's a big old canvas doesn't take quite a while but anyway this is what was in the rucksack from l'oréal it's a bounce energy ball peanut protein that's I would say peanut protein blast there you go achoo mix of peanuts and wing protein you know we do through the gym you got any good protein also dad if you watch this vlog please turn away now and don't watch this next bit okay because I'm gonna mention something that's for you so don't don't watch this bit I get asked this quite a lot Joe what do you smell like that's on very weird people that neatly sometimes say that I smell really nice like meet and greets and stuff and this is what I wear it's Victor Rolf and I think I mentioned in a Q&A one source I mentioned on Twitter actually adds and someone asked me what what spray I use I use Viktor and Rolf spicebomb since then they saw it and now they've already sent me another one of these fragrances but they've also sent me this a Victor AMA spiced born barber shop nonfamily shaving cream they also sent me the natural spray which I really want are things I can't really you I am only just dying to shave absolutely embarrassing I'm 24 I'm only just started shave so I've been putting that to one side and the other thing they gave me was this which is a nourishing pre a nourishing nourishing preshave oil so what I'm going to do I think I'm gonna wrap these up and give them I kind of really want this though because I love the spray but I've already got one so I'm gonna give this to my dad as you may wanna know Father's Day is approaching us Father's Day is on Sunday hopefully you're not thinking oh but you're just gonna give a present that you got for free uh so but if he wears the thought roller it kind of is to be fair yeah okay I am a rubbish son but I also think that it's a kind of thing that I would give my dad anyway for Father's Day like you can't go wrong with smelly stuff and stuff for personal hygiene it's a winwin it's kind of saying you stink slit yourself out I love you you know it takes all three boxes I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you it looks a little bit like a nutty poo sorry if you're eating while watching this but it doesn't taste too bad it's quite a nice taste so I'm supposed to start a new thing in my vlogs um back back in the day I you see the paper every single day and there's always stories in the paper but most let's be honest most of paper is like doom and gloom and so I've decided that maybe some days I will maybe sometime I will touch on like serious subjects in the paper but I forget for the paper and read out some of the funny stories that have made the news and then share with you guys because what if I get is that a lot of you're watching me from all on the world so things that have in the UK that weren't necessarily make the news where you are watching you may do live but I just want to find some funny stories and read them out to you so I've got my paper I'm going to take what paper could you put a laugh at me okay I found a story dog bite on penis what way to start what we start is little segments of my vlogs a family dog chomped on a delivery man's will as he dropped off parcels a court heard thing is this is why I'm scared of dogs but this is why I've always grown up scared of dogs because you get some dogs out there actually let me have a look for a bit I bet you I could tell you what's or breed is Daniel died said the Rottweiler slash German Shepherd cross okay that's that's different the dog out there I heard a story this might be a myth alright and it's put a lot of other that owners dogs Staffordshire Bull Terriers a quite a controversial breed in the news because there's been a lot of them there aren't trained properly that have been on to bite children and people but I heard us a story he I know if it's true or not but I heard a rumor that Wednesday bite down something the only way from to actually release their jaw is by sticking your thumb up there at their bumhole I don't know if that's true I don't think it is true but there's only one way to find out and I don't really want to do that myself this guy was delivering parcels on a dog him out nowhere and bit him right on the the willy and is to go okay the animals owner blow out control okay they admit to an owl control dog don't get a dog unless you're intending on training it and looking after it and giving it like giving it the attention it needs and making sure that you can actually look after the pet always just don't do it that's why have a dog because I know about a dog I wouldn't look after if I well because I'm always away and I'm you know look at me I kind of got a dog may one day well Sui have here as a

she's eating for two that's why she's snacking eightmonths what dare you do the 27 november that's crazy guys I don't want to be a complainer about my new computer but I'm kind of hating it because look at all this extra crap that I have a lot of this is just like from camera stuff but these things come unplugged so easily it's crazy I was trying to show you guys how they come unplugged you're just like oh I'm not even filming they come out like a tiny minute it disconnects like everything I'm working on this thing we got it at Best Buy at the guy at the Apple Store like recommended that we get this really don't like it it's been really really hard I've just basically been sitting here and like editing and doing computer stuff in the past like literally I think like four or five days I'm just on the computer all day getting stuff done and I was editing my video for the week which is up now I'll link it down below the testing I seen on tv products but I was editing and I had almost the entire thing done and that I needed to film something else I wasn't filmed it and then it had like unplugged all my stuff I hadn't even touched it I seriously swear like don't touch the computer and then it just tells me my stuff's unplug and I'm like making sure that it's like plugged in and really steady and I'm not like being crazy and it just comes unplugged I went to go open my library back up and try all cut and it was like oh this library is damaged it can't like read this folder it was like I thought it was gone but then it gave me an option to open like a backup file so I could do that but then it wasn't like as far I didn't is like what I had already done so far I'm not sure about this computer she's been really frustrating because I literally will sit here and like not even be moving and it'll be like oh your hard drives been unplugged and then I'll like click the ok button or like eject or whatever and then it just keeps keep saying it over and over again even when I'm not moving so it's been a little bit frustrating but I think after today I will finally be it caught up with all of my work trying to figure out some kind of new schedule or new system for just like working and editing so I feel like I'm not vlogging anything but me like sitting and talking and I know you guys like that but I don't want that in everything the vlog for like the entire vlog like I want to do stuff and like just like live life like vlog what I'm doing instead of just like talking to the camera like that it I'm trying to figure out a new schedule but I have to like get caught up first so I'm working on our Bali vlog right now I asked on Twitter if you guys wanted to see a travel diary or travel guide so I was just waiting where is my phone it's only been a couple hours but let me see what is winning so far I need to get this done okay travel diary is winning so far I have started on that so I'm just gonna get that done I did a blog post which I'll link down below and we

my iPhone 6 in the bath so I grabbed it like inci literally like a ninja like it dropped or not I still got it out straight away took the case off of it dried it over towel it all seemed to be working

technology or in the toilet you put it in rice so moment of truth then did a dirt better then don't done is it going to work ha it's working but what is that the cable accessory is not certified the

that's good isn't it you can hear me yeah yes guys it's working the only thing is that it said on the screen as you saw this accessory does not work with this charger and it wasn't plugged into a charger so that's the only thing I'm scared about right this is the selfie that I was taking everyone are you ready it's not so great this run this one and then drop my phone oh my god picture why she dropped oh that's my arm yeah I let my little mole that's my arm as I dropped it I made an agreement with Zoe earlier that if she takes not like Babu because nyla needed a poo at the time that I would

put me an appointment to get my phone fixed and all I have to do is walk in pay the fifty five pounds and now hopefully either give me a new one that would be the best option or fix the current one

go Nishi mineral boost for Simon something daily booster this is about notices like a clear button super serum that's really hydrating gel serum one thing I will not skimp on is putting on my skincare in morning I'm going to call a little bit as the american airlines are doing my skin again is looking so good at the moment so pleased i think is just some mixtures in care as well using like I said before Alan to a dermatologist who is amazing I will see you next week I cannot wait and now let's new here my dermatologist is called Bianca out be skin clinically fair links down below she is amazing kind of way to see her again I've got so much love any moisturizer activity and 400 bamboo thanks so one of the hydrator no I knew that I was going to have no bear foundation today but that's that's turning to this so I was just going to go for concealer and a very light amount of foundation or you're just going to see level well replenish like might loose it minimal effort I'm just going to make sure my under eyes a concealed because this looking so dark Burt's Bees the Rimmel liner a little bit of sleigh on right then I'm Jenna nude I'm ready and with a lot more makeup on the nicest anticipated but at least I look alive to the main thanks to my man salsa was it and I sure really I was watching an outfit earlier for Dior and if I'm lucky apartment and she was wearing my new sunglasses in it someone yes it's a good enough enough support man's got nothing nice although obviously obviously i blatantly got them first so joking okay nice so I've just been out having my nails done how pretty they look most maverick the Brassica most pink so pretty and now the description of it and I'm not have a lunch with one of my good friends from uni Rachel in pharmacy my absolute favorite and Lafon grow and love it here amazing bugle food you know pretty manual for looking fishy my favorite dessert whatever listen to this one and excuse my friend Rachel isn't it great all the pubs got the camera in the felt I don't know I mean pillow underneath this hi guys bit later on now so I have my little image from a friend and it's got back to the flat and just been trying to do a few things we love moving flaps next month I've realized there's quite a lot of things that I don't have for listing flat for instance is going to look third bedroom that's going to be like my closet wardrobe space which is amazing and I'm super excited about it because I definitely know desperately desperately need that and there's no more room here for anything else so I need to buy in got loads of cupboard space sign to buy like big shoe racks I'm going to get some bookcases so it's going to be like shoe racks and all that so that's taken if you are such an intern aside furniture and then I just had a lot of emails to get through so just in doing those and I'm just feeling like super stressed out at the moment and I feel like if I actually spend five minutes and probably think about everything I would probably cry nasty I mean my birthday was with I mean it's good enough but I didn't really do anything like me nights and grateful of the meal and celebrate it and enjoy it announce that I was working in seeing amazing things like casting a project with your and an event which is great but it wasn't really celebrating my birthday so I don't really feel like I've had a birthday this year in complete honesty which is why I went to do all of the day and spontaneously it's not treated myself to big purchase with a lot of savings expels like I just really want to kind of just go enjoy myself comes to little stressed out and fun just something to kind of make me feel really good again so that's what I did I mean that's what people do with retail therapy internet I'm going to put you here so that I can get as much sounds were showing that it really her birthday then I it has been stressful on the flat which in a pack boxes we've barely got any room to put said packed boxes yes so there might have been constants like viewings because this play still hasn't rented out yet because probably because of a view at the back it's like the most tightly view ever so that's really stressing me out because people are constantly coming into my flat where my stuff is everything is just completely SMS so it's really difficult I thought by now that would have easily rented and then we could have started packing boxes and it wouldn't have mattered well this point I'm not waiting for it to rim before I start packing some other time I've just got a lot a lot a lot of work on right now amazing work amazing projects and collaborations and I'm so so happy I'm working on some incredible things it just song it hard to do anything because I have so much is on the fly there's not enough headspace to deal with each thing individually so a bit stressed out my whole weekend is work event photo shoot so I don't have a weekend really I never do next week is events and things yes I feel like I just need a day off actually on a day off and I've not got well until the week after next I'm just trying to think about it a lot something really really stressed out and one rightsizing note which I don't think I've actually mentioned is I had my braces took off of my teeth on the top low the bottom ones are still on there they'll still be on there for a few more weeks we take off the top first and because let things settle a little bit rather than take off the bottom to see how I've since Lewis but it's great so far I'm so happy I love the way my teeth look I could not recommend them more it's a London lingual orthodontics planet believe information down below for you but I could not recommend the more I've had incredible service it's been amazing treatment thrill of a clinic so yeah I honestly can't recommend them anymore if you're thinking of getting the treatment as a young person or as level so that's one thing that is really brightened up week actually I did realize was going to get into enough that I did so that was great those two dresses by the way okay so very similar put a little exam below or you can get them the super cute this one it's like a Bardot with cool sleeves on it and this one it would be flat lacy dress I love the one I'm wearing on Friday for an event and there's a lot of wear and I was only for an event so I'm going go like

early anymore we woke up really early you want to explain what happened I miss my flight Alex was supposed to go to Colorado because he had some points and he had to use them up because they're gonna expire and you woke up early I drove him to the airport but we missed we were too late so and I was having to stay here around the area of the airport because my mom is getting in town she was getting in at noon and he was leaving at like 8: something he's chilling with me and we're waiting for my mom and we're at the Santa Monica third the street whatever and we're just gonna walk around your flights later today I didn't but I was working until 2: well we've been doing today too tiring so we uploaded our vlog yeah basically we upload a vlog today and that one was called Alex and Sierra are over and we got a reaction I did not expect to get heat on it be honest I didn't either basically we upload this vlog and we got a reaction that we didn't expect to get I believe the comments were saying well they were actually more sore than Eve and then we were both saying it so that really bugs me the other fear and Alex from xfactor broke up and we were saying that were the only ones the only couple with that name now so we were like oh like now there's not gonna be confusion and people thought we were like happy that they broke up I am NOT glad that someone else is in pain who I don't know if they're in pain we they're happy they're broken up maybe it's a good thing but I'm just saying like I wasn't happy because they broke up I was just like Oh like we're the only couple with that name now I just it's not even about the situation just like the fact that we're getting so much hate about just random things lately like just that I wouldn't even expect like I I don't know it just is really frustrating because I just feel like okay just I don't know people just misunderstand because I just the realest people compared to so many other youtubers I understand one thing YouTube is no matter what you guys want to say what YouTube is now it is like a job and so this job requires to get you guys interested in watching us and we love like vlogging and stuff guys but we are like turn be as real as possible we don't wanna do stuff like you're not gonna stage our vlogs and do things just for a dog that's fake it ruins relationships not throwing shade any other you know it happens a lot more than you think on probably your favorite youtubers vlogs and the amount of freaking cook baits out there that like we don't you barely do it we barely clicked it and like one time that I didn't even think it was a big deal that we'd do it there's just so much hate and like I see people do it every for every vlog that they post and I'm just like how how is this how are they so loved like yeah say we're boring it's like okay but we're being real normal people and like I don't know that's what I like to watch and so I don't want to watch a fake life I think okay maybe it's like entertaining for 20 minutes but it's not the real life so and you don't want to be like that you have to realize one thing to when you watch someone's vlog that is staged and compared to ours we don't just wake up and like oh like let's do this and stage this in the vault like no I mean Sarah very like spontaneous we're like let's just walk like a normal person's day because we're normal people most people now are like oldest Baugus extraordinary life like this drama this drama that that that it's not what we're doing we're not trying to seek drama but yeah when something like relevant or on our name which it was and it's kind of like you know we got so many tweets we got so many comments like oh just the ban this stack messages but that's like like that's not me yeah we don't even wish the couple bad we like alright you can hear and like I wanted them to break up but it's not even a bad thing I mean in the video you can hear I say like oh I wish them the best like we're not that we're happy that they broke up we hope that they're okay that we said that without work commenting you have a right to say these things and that's part of YouTube and whatever you have you have a right to your opinion but I like having knowledge of when you're commenting it like what you're really saying because in this video I'm defending us for a reason because one Ciara's my fiance I I'm gonna protect her for the rest of my life I love you guys we care for you guys we keep it real like we are right now and so this like Ciara crying and being upset you guys and I just don't want people to think like I'm complaining in this video you guys heard us say something but wasn't out of bad intentions to shame another relationship or or anything like that legit like you have to look the circumstances of how where we're coming from we're not wishing these people bad luck I wish them the best if we did offend you alright but what we said and if we offended the other Alex in Sierra we are sorry that was not our intention at all guys we are human beings were not perfect nobody is perfect in this world and if you have there's an illusion on YouTube that youtubers are perfect that as false completely we're gonna try to be better people every day and you know we're gonna keep it real with you guys every day when we do vlog we just wanna thank you so much for watching our videos and we just want to spread positivity and just make your day better guys let's just spread good vibes spread love because let me tell you one thing that I was raised with knowing anything that he can do love can do better so if you just even if you know guys you have some that you don't like just do it out of love don't do it ever out of hate because I will never get you anywhere take you backwards into a circle and whenever you wish on other people is what you're gonna get in return that's something else I know so wish great things for people and great things will happen to you so we love you guys thank you for watching our videos and we will see you in the next vlog peace"	2009

I'm sending one to Esther I wouldn't mind doing a little like viewer letterwriting thing I don't know how we would manage it because I couldn't commit to writing very many a week and I wouldn't want to like disappoint people so I have a think about it and either at the end of the vlog talk about it all next week I've written dear Esther praise Jesus the children are back at school I have loved spending more time at Darcy but energy is running though thanks for being a constant playdate support love Louise because whenever we run out of things to do where do we go we go to Esther's because her daughter is friends with Darcy they're in the same class at school so we go to Esther's and Esther feeds this luxury sandwiches like not just a cheese sandwich like mozzarella and bass or sundried tomato submerges and the girls play it's really nice so that's what I'm gonna write her address on it these things are so cool like this you just fold them over not only on your face and then it's all done good morning it's a Tuesday and it's about half past eight and I'm feeling particularly ambitious today I'm going to try and get a thousand words returned and a video filmed before all my guests arrive at about half finish so wish me luck that's orbit but he's not really in the mood to play they'll come out soon when they get you see Ethan what I haven't really convey probably is that

ages since I last filmed had a really nice dinner John does his hair he'll wash put it to bed now I've really printed out a little popcorn pop soda popcorn and we're going to watch The Handmaid's Tale if we can find it and relax I realize this is a horrible angle about what you propped up on an ornament again it's Josie's first day back at school this morning and I was watching everyone do all that give it back things and that is it my person that blog posts and being super emotional and I was saying I'm not just not that emotional like she's going into year two we've done this before I know what I'm doing I know all the parent all the teachers everything's fine but weirdly this morning I am feeling a bit like come on baby I'm also working it I can't hear out this there so if I'm talking about way that's why I don't know Clara no I'm telling you this is that this is the stuff you need this is the globe Mac soft and gentle I have actually washed my brushes since the last time we spoke but you wouldn't be able to tell which so yeah she's going to school she's downstairs having some breakfast I like labeled all the school uniform I don't know why why do you feel emotional about it I think it's because this is the last time I'll be taking her to school as an only child and then next year when she starts you three should have a little sister no I'm also last night I like went into a room or to sleep for a while I was like oh I love these summer we've had to get there and all our little adventures usually have much bigger summers than this and we travel but I haven't booked lots of day trips and picnics and the park and snowballs and read books and it's just it's so lovely my pony out when I'm coming back and I'm going to spend the day let me put my hair back again I'm going to spend the day off my feet because my back has been really playing I've had a really lovely bath it really really helped alleviate it and then I went to bed and had loads of like support pillows and that really really helped I think I've just been overdoing it a bit but it's been writing up starting we're done like a zillion play dates and stuff playing yada yada say and rather than go to London today just going to chill out who'sa to chill out and edit some videos I've got stored up so I'm going up tonight actually not your tonight because your tomato some day but went the whole Wednesday

yes okay bit of lipstick I think we're very presentable for the school gates further let's let's choose a lipstick now I don't want to go too bold maybe this one it's a nice one yes okay it is too bold I had to put about 45 layers on because I had so much lip balm on that it just kept sliding about so now now I do look too bold I look aggressive almost I'd be like good morning good morning everybody good morning and yeah okay let's do this I brought the kittens up to help me right but you're not really helping me it's so cute so this one here's orbit and that one curve there is milky what do you doing what are you doing they play like this all day if they're not sleeping they're playing they're never just chill the time it's about accuracy let me know if you know what that's from is 12 minutes past 3:00 there it is trust me I'm having a break I've been having a break for ages actually had a plumber coax my showers broken about that and I'm going to redo my main bathroom to be like my old one which I bloody love and how does deliveries I'm so excited I've started Christmas shopping now I realize is in September but we have a lot of kiddie Winx in our family and so I've started just buying little stocking stuffers and some of them are so freaking at gorgeous so the first one I'm really really excited about sure to get this package there I'll take it out just a little bit so for one of my cousins okay she's a preteen I bought these for her and they are mermaid makeup brushes I don't think these are like the best quality brushes you'll ever get in your life I absolutely love Real Techniques they're the ones I use all the time but if you're like the preteen or a teenager or are you just really freaking like mermaids at my friends Kayle Kayle if you're watching let me know I hate them and for all of these there's loads of them one two three four five six seven eight like ten ten twelve about ten a nine pound something I really wanna keep this myself and for her I also picked her up some chunky unicorn at glitter there we go and I really like it because it's got like the actual big chunks I've always thought oh I'll just use craft glitter but this is the kind of stuff that you like for body glitter and stuff you would like put on your face and body and when I got it recommended a glue to use with it so I just bought that glue like there's like the blue is like a pound this was like under five I'm not entirely sure for Daphne and her fouryearold cousin I bought galaxy slime because as we discovered last week kids love slime look at that I won't take outs it's for them but galaxy slime galaxy slime it is so slimy and galaxy and so I just bought two of those I'm not focused on trim how much would I have I'll just link everything below and then if you want to see how much it is you can go but I haven't spent very much at all because these are just little stocking stuffers and I bought a fidget cute I freaking hate fidget spinners everyone loves them there's something about them I think is because they I started singing around when I was just nearly pregnant everything made me feel sick of seeing those little things was around whoa the motion of it but I bought to fidget phoebs one for Liam and one may I try it out actually and it's these little cubes these little cubes that have like this little choice if they're these buttons to push this is always round like Liam is always always about satisfying what's on that one little Robbie um yeah Liam always try that spins around that is satisfying he's a fidgeter I'm at 52

why do they make packets so bloodied so much bloody bigger oh what's all that for what is that what is that actually for please Walker's to explain it's almost midnight and I have cried hard Becky oh sorry I'll turn the camera on leaves coming up I'm gonna end it here for today see so many upset because I was just enjoying her company into the teacher and she has also it's not like Claire who's a teacher here at the film all the time because I've known her for ages and ages yeah Bob I you get it bill good morning good morning so orbit is obsessed with this it's on my camera good morning is that what you would like I'm thrilled because I have broken the 10,000 word mark on my book and once you've done that first 10, ah that is my hand it gets bit easier it's very hard to work when you're here little because yeah you look cute oh you are savaging me you are a little Savage yes yes there's your brother Oh going give him a little kiss or Savage Jim good morning it's Friday it's not actually the morning it's about lunchtime and I haven't vlogged yet today obviously as you can tell um I just felt a bit shit today to be honest with you um I've been feeling quite not nice about myself physically for a while actually since I got pregnant really and then this morning I read some comments that people have left on my video I did about a pregnant day out or night it went to the trending page which is always dangerous and then everyone was like why is this trending she's obviously paid for it to be done I was like one if I could pay for that to be done I'd be trending number one every week I obviously haven't paid for this video I don't know how the algorithm works but sometimes stuff goes on the trending page and it's always quite good when it does because it means you get more views but sometimes not and then you only want to give it like I don't want to give haters attention but people were just saying really unpleasant things like who would want to get her pregnant and OH two babies by two daddies oh she's obviously just doing it for the benefits which made me long that it's just like unless it's about that people are saying really horrible things about my way and I've been seeing things like that for a while now and the truth of the matter is hello and the truth of the matter is I am bigger than it was last year I am and I think I just was really happy and comfortable in a nice relationship but we were like cozying up with a sofa like eating yummy food together and I just will say Darcy doesn't know Co separate meals like I could forever L in the day and she's like beautiful as ever but I have fun wait I'm gonna got pregnant I'm trying a wall wait it's just not nice when people point it out because it's true hang on I'm very hormonal as well obviously it just makes me feel a bit worthless I'm like even though I know not to listen to people but things like that sometimes you do it sometimes it does like get through a crack and it does sink in sometimes and did you think I am just I am disgusting or I am this around so I'm not going to dwell on it I'm not going to think it all day but this is like a blog of the week and when I look back next year I'm like you know what almost logs in my pregnancy stuff this is the thing that I felt this week so there we are I said it now no point dwelling on it we've arrived at Rushton Lakes his is not happy Louis heads like it's that John Lewis who drove me like where John Lewis it's like this house of Fraser's like it's not true Lewis she's like well someone told me it was a journalist or

Mike and I are walking to get record we were going to go hiking this morning guys and look at the poor visibility look great I mean of you know gray and why so apparently the sun's going to be coming out this afternoon so we might change our plan my kid just got dressed normally so he doesn't feel like a fool ie because I'm in gym gear and ready to go hiking and we're not going to go hiking because we'll get up there and they'll be no views and we rubbish the moment up goes afternoon have a little moment this morning we're going just around the corner from our hotel to a place called I think it's called the larder and when we will find out we do out meal I promised the oatmeal or porridge I knock you English on schooling you always thank the egg once again I'm trying to convince Mike to try my green juice yes please I have a set my feet look like water clean should look like that was like this irrelevant soon get four years generally not the veggies around believe I like my vegetables ambition not the mission continue now to stop your strong with you you've got crazy bit of hair and then I was going on that mean I meant about this before I started eating it and it looked like Messi's lava oatmeal like it was really happening now so I mix it all together like wasn't berries green juice might not really that make it looks insane and poached eggs which is topped in Trader Joe's on the way past as we saw her and miss this one like mayonnaise with this chip and in and out 30 mayonnaise or so the only size they have this is this one to put it into perspective is when you think might can go in with that size mayonnaise I'm not so sure so the hiking was abandoned I can't remember five pounds the sun's coming out the Sun is now coming out okay so basically what happened this morning was we were meant to be going hiking at like 9:00 because the weather forecast said that someone's income online it didn't it just starting to come out now and it's so what we did was we went back and got ready to go out and then we're now going to four because I want to do a realtime for a whole lemon here we're going to the Beverly Hills before because it's as far as I know like the biggest one in LA it's my favorite one anyway we're going to don't go do that and I'm going to go hiking this afternoon like after lunch probably what I'll punch in other words make you hot because planning the weather is much better so not going to meet yeah that's what's going down and I want to show you guys my outfits also really like my awesome thing we're just doing a bit of a window shopping and they're playing on Rodeo Drive ain't no mountain high love out speakers along the street I mean that is great I'm going to sell out so today we hold oh how kind of a goal like my thing next so this is my new ride guys yes go website no no the day wearing or what Levi is and just on playing white preacher Topshop roughly skirt which is way shorter the back so keep em shut down my customer and only read through packs mike tells me apparently i can't spray my many that color he doesn't approve I think we should go for a sunset hike because you know what it's actually got really hot and sunny now I don't think we can go this afternoon the things will go and suck and cold you were just thinking every we somehow found ourselves in the kids Department of Barneys look at this power unicorn ah Mike is desperate rightfully Lou I've just been her birthday you very naughty I want one so you have comes in an hour for lunch because I'm with Mike and that's how I roll along with my life so we've ended up going to use me without without having a done amount because you always have we haven't been here for a year I had one awesome anyway so we're now we've ended up in the queue for the drivethru we didn't necessarily want to do a drivethru but we couldn't find anywhere to park and we ended up getting in the queue to the drivethru thinking that it was a car park but doing a drivethru candle and now this is something I've never seen before they give you a map for your lap so you don't get animal cell juice all over you just kind of a good idea now this is the torturous part of the bike because I have all the food on my lap and he has to drive and find somewhere to eat it where we can park up all over ha ha I'm going to eat my fries are still too hot to hike in my opinion so come up to viewpoint on Mulholland Drive and this is the few pretty awesome you can see all the way around like the whole of La that the coolest house in the world that with an infinity pool there how awesome would that be and then you turn around here and there's a Hollywood sign up there and libris Observatory is over there is a pretty awesome I've never been up to this point before you can see loads so we've come to Everly in West Hollywood for dinner we have some delicious mussels so it's really cute in here they have the best view you guys currently see from here but so pretty yeah we got some crab and some steak sure sorry delicious when you finish at 7:00 a.m. in LA guys and we're on the road we took our rising maturity on the bases it's like yeah I mean it's probably enough near summit afternoon so that I learn that Mike is it was like I don't get jet lag I don't get jet lag my alarm went off at 5:30 this morning and like 10 minutes later you were like been awake I was like definitely a little bit jet like at home you would not really like that oh no no but at the same time it's good you know with stuff going on this weekend got to get a selfie fine chained to the dragon I was like this weekend event next weekend we don't know me to jail I will get home because we have run before like how many days are doing it back three days after we get back which bit of an update for you guys on run for it in a week and a half so if you guys want to donate please do I'll put a link below because we're doing a cocktail here an awesome charity to basically try and educate young women on how to check their breasts so that they don't develop breast cancer early and it goes on treated which is really common when younger people get breast cancer because either they're not checking or they are too embarrassed to go and see the doctor or they don't know where to go well they just kind of ignore it thinking there's nothing wrong anyway copperfield awesome saving live and so we are doing a half marathon for them however I've got shin splints and I'm not going to be able to run it and I'm so glad about this it's like my own event like we organize this and like with the girls from coppaFeel and I'm absolutely gutted because during the training process I will get the point where it gets like five or six miles and then get really bad incidents have to take a few weeks off and then start again so I've been doing that on repeat like three or four times and it's just not getting any better so I'm not picking up to run it basically and I have tent length okay and then also add insult to injury I make training convincing speeds up pull my car I still have hope that you're sewing about sonic biking that is nothing more than I kind of doing some strengthening on it and it's a little sore this morning but I'm hopeful I can get it with lately I've got a couple of video sessions from her back she's going to tape me up and we'll hope like this knock it out and do it that way me well like in a bad way but well in American might refer to Berlin if anybody knows your local she's doing the Berlin Marathon in summer so anyway I'm currently trying to devise a way still run it and it may involve a bike it may involve walking it may involve both I still don't know but any of your support that you can give because there's about 30 other people running it with me or running it because I'm not going to running it and I hope you'll have like as much as a bicycle would like it getting water on it yeah I think close with music and water I think this have a boat with a basket I don't have water and snacks no I have licensed Italy so if I get like five miles and I be like yeah I can so I can like stalk everyone on my bike anyway

yeah so giving you the other half the bacon on our way my recent read with parsley UNMIK me one time and I just changed my shoes back into yesterday's shoes and they're so uncomfortable so wow that's like crazy we've just finished moneta with hearty anarchy very fun and we've checked out VidCon and we're now heading Santa Monica so what I'm really going which anybody doesn't know why we say send someone they could let us out and I would say it and which is sad like that anyway so we're going Santa Monica for a couple of nights before we head home we're actually staying in a hotel which shutters on the beach which I've always wanted to stay in and we've never stayed there for quite fancy I thought it would be quite nice to have a little prevent they treat me from what really happened and stay there for the rest of the weekend which I'm excited about so we're heading there tonight and then we're going out for a romantic meal together oh and then we're actually hanging out with some of the guys from my management team who wholesome tomorrow and then hopefully we're seeing the key and down and party and James long music oh I'm literally be tomorrow yes tomorrow night and day we're

you talk about it in socializing but otherwise it'd be hanging out on the beach and this one that doesn't have like the beach nostrils or socializing setting we've got about an hour's drive now so let's get some I'm looking kind of crazy right now because I have a crazy blueblack blown face mask on and I've actually missed the day of logging so the last time you guys saw us we are on our way to shutters in Santa Monica which is where we are now when we arrived I was so tired from VidCon I basically like slept for 12 hours like we got room service and we slept from like eight till eight and it was great and then yesterday Mike and I just hung out and I didn't really vlog just because I know I felt like chilling out together and not vlogging so today is our last day we're actually heading home tonight we have Rousseau's breakfast on the way and then we're heading out to meet Nicky and Dan and I think also seeing tarty and James today as well so I fun with your little room tour actually it's kind of a bit of a mess in here because we've already slept in the bed and everything we're just packing up our stuff ready to go but it's the cutest room I love the style of this hotel it's like very kind of like old American kind of vibe the bed is so comfortable as well it's unbelievable this is my excited and we like currently packing up all our suitcases and all that jazz so nice little armchair and then we have a balcony but we don't really have a view so our view is like this is the pool area then we have like a stairway which is a shame but you have to pay so much money if you want to get one of those rooms that looks over the sea you have to get like yeah a bit of standee and then in here you decent right so as I was saying we have a filter window which goes into the bottom which is super cute and I actually had a bath in this ginormous bath which is full of our dirty towels because we're getting ready to check out last night and I filled it I got yours I thought

quite revealing otherwise just wearing in the daytime I quite like it layered up as well and I have all my black PR examples and that is it haven't done anything with my hair and I've got pretty minimal makeup on because I can't be bothered and my sunglasses are from Jimmy's so they found the best shorts ever what are you wrecking ball so we've walked down all the way from Santa Monica to Venice my little beach walk Mike's carrying my bags you can ever so stylish and we're going to go and meet Nikki for a coffee when we walk out to the ocean come on miss I hate sand I've also tied my

"no_FRIEND TEST, HAULING & ORGANISING.txt"	"good morning everybody I am up in my office this morning I'm having to use one of my old cameras it's probably really smeary it is ah that's better I've been sort of tidying up a little bit this morning because I've got Lilly and Amma coming because they are going to be doing their podcast at home with and I am guest number ten which is very exciting I actually listened to their podcast every Wednesday because I am such a huge like interior abuse yes so not only do I really enjoy the interviews with the people that they've been to visit but I love that it's in their homes and that you can like see little snippets of their home and they sort of talk a little bit about their home interiors because I am really into that so all in all of the air they are coming round in a couple of hours this is my vlog camera look at the state of this I do need to order anyone but this this one will do in the meantime this is just the g7x I've had this for a while it's just that the focus is not as good so I think before they come round I really want to nip the garden center and grab a few plants I've got so many empty like plant pots to put plants in them I've been getting really fucking plants her go to the plant shop and I'm like for something like I think in my mind I think Holt something quite specific but I don't I don't really know what do you like my dress by the way and I actually ordered this to wear to the gleam festival party but my DPD driver doesn't knock on the door so he just left and he took my parcel with him so I didn't get it and that was like an hour before we had to leave so this is what I was gonna wear you know how I can show you it just like a floaty offtheshoulder maxi dress I'll leave a little link in the description box is from ASOS but I think it's a brand though I spent quite a lot of yesterday kind of trying to sort the house out a little bit because as part of the in as podcast they take pictures and I'll work on God we've still got like this which is like boxes and paintings and things that we haven't put away but I did tidy like the main areas and I'm like really happy with them we're in the garden centre looking at plants and Perth we have a lot in our trolley so many I'm just looking at all the plant pots and also trying to Alfa's on the phone trying to work out which one of these big plants I want for the office I kind of like this with other like differently we finish filming oh wait wipe it recording voice a weird thing I was doing home inaudible it was so much fun I can't wait to hear it thanks for coming good yeah so you guys though I I do think it would be harder to interview yeah I don't know one do it I don't think I could do what you guys do sometimes we have a coordinate you disagree far are you alright are looking on my punishment we don't great by incoming fucking so good it is I'm really excited to hear it wasn't good and we talked about you a little bit I also want to do today is also the launch of the pink stuff on thug life which I'm so excited about I think the pink hoodie is probably I mean I'm going to say it's quite a favor but I feel like it's probably my favorite thing we've ever released just because I slip in love pink they're so soft and so comfortable and I've been wearing mine like pretty much ever since we had a sample of ones oh got some here wow that is really satisfying just like split into like I'm exploiting okay I'm not important one now because it is farting hot but I'm sure I'll be wearing on for you later oh she's in the cutest mood today good morning everybody it is now Saturday I have a really lovely day yesterday with Anna and Lydia filming the podcast we got to catch up it was so much fun they actually brought me the most beautiful bunch of flowers let me show you them oh hello Nana she's just chillin here are the flowers aren't they so pretty they thank you very much girls again for those today it's a bit of a kind of odd jobs day really me now he went out this morning and I have her I got a new camera yeah I'm so happy I've got a new g7x mark too so although yesterday my trusty old camera was fine it was very slow to focus and I don't know if you can tell from the quality of yesterday's footage and today's footage but I personally think it looks so much better when we got up I just shoved on one of our these tshirts just to kind of like quickly get out the house like all this will do I just put this on to go downstairs technology on all day and I kind of liked it it looks kind of like a tshirt dress so I'm going to leave it on I like roll the sleeves up and just left I've got my mess oh my necklaces on the only difference between this morning and now is I have a bra on so I don't look as like I've just jumped out of bed but I kind of liked it so I'm gonna leave this on another thing I'm going to be doing today is just not wearing a makeup I want to have a makeup free day which I do always enjoy and I think my skin always enjoyed it my skins actually looking a lot better besides this one here which hasn't actually amounted to anything and this one here which has gone now my skin generally is looking heaps better at the moment aha you're on your little bird nah Papi's come in it's probably coming you never really know where this is looking I think it's at me you're supposed to pop you coming over in a minute and we're going to head to the garden centre because yesterday as you will have seen me now if you went and bought quite a few houseplants because we have a quite a few little spaces we want to fill and the dream for me is to just have a house as houseplants and I'm doing so well at keeping them alive guys this house is so much better for plants than our other house our other house has much lower ceilings and smaller windows and it did not have a lot of natural light at all whereas this house is kind of the complete opposite so plants seem to be really enjoying themselves which makes me very very happy we got this one yesterday look at it I love it and I put it in this planter which I think I got from Scandinavian design center or cb2 and I've popped this plant in I really love these leaves they look like weird hearts and some of them I still have down here in a dining room because I don't know where I'm going to put them yet but I really liked them so

the morning every time we want to come as outside to like eat or to have like a table because the South is amazing like lounge but you can't really focus like almost some day much you yeah so there's like chillin but this is like breakfast yeah I'm loading up my top right cool it is so nice I might sit out here for a bit I am crying at The Voice kids oh my god is so emotional I'm every week it's on you guys have to watch it it's so good or they're doing like all the battles now I think it's because they're kids it just makes me like way more emotional if I'm completely honest I don't watch the voice when it's adults but I've gotten so into the kids version because I literally cannot believe the amount of talent these children have and they're all so humble and so lovely and they have absolutely no inhibitions and they just go for it and I just it's just so emotional like I can't even deal with it this boy is the cutest thing I need to pull myself together good morning everybody it is now Monday and actually I have already had a meeting this morning I had a meeting about thug life which is very exciting we talked about look at this horse fly oh my god they are so ugly that we had a meeting about so guys which is very exciting talked about some new launches literally cannot believe how quickly the hoodie sold out I don't know if I mentioned this on here because I don't think I was logging on that day but oh my god the hoodie sold out in like 27 minutes or something ridiculous so we are going to be restocking those soon so we didn't manage to get one this time then keep your eye out I think you can put your email in and then we'll send you an email when they're about to go live so then you won't miss it but really up to you or you can just like set an alarm but we don't have a date yet but when we do have a date that they're going to be restocked we will let you know and now I am like tidying I've done like the washing up but one thing that I thought you might want to join me in is sorting out this cupboard now since this kitchen is new we're sort of trying to get used to where to put things and this is kind of a snack zone and the cereal zone and the drink alone there's a lot going on in here this zone is a lot so I'm trying to organize it so this is what it looks like now I ordered loads of Muji storage which I'm going to unwrap now and I think what I'm gonna do is put some like well that might is huge some acrylic storage inside that so then it has a little bit more order so I'm basically going to be organizing my kitchen cupboards which I know is not everyone's cup of tea but there is an e shower I'm now waving a knife at you there is a niche out there for organizing and decluttering cupboards and I for one love it okay now we have all our clear boxes it is time to make some order of these cupboards okay so the first thing I think I'm going to do is put cereal bars in one and healthy snacks in another and we've already got unhealthy chocolate bars in a jar so that's fine thanks okay alright let's do this okay I'm happy with that the only thing I think I could do with is something to put its gets in I think I'm going to put biscuit in this this is a fairly happy jar although I do have all this you're probably watching this like so it's not everyone needs to organize their because guess what we're not that unhealthy we don't need a biscuit jar well let's be honest most people have biscuit jars is not just me does anyone have those jars of biscuits like the Kardashians where you like proper stack the more I've always wondered about that because I just feel like surely they never eat them because then they would want to restock them so the ones that have probably been there a really long time or do they eat more it's a question I would love an answer to to be honest oh my God look at this caterpillar what the hell look how fast it is okay biscuit jar number one this is a great selection of biscuit I'm really happy with this and I'm going to go and put these back in the pantry because I mean the pantry is for food those particular you want to put them in the cupboard because they've got the orange lids which go to the orange arrow which aesthetically looks quite nice so I'm going to government these back on the shelf in other words and there we go your biscuit next to your teapot I like that got yay you get me and I did look in the window girls are lying nice you know where she is too quiet in there and we're done as you can see we have a lot more order to the cupboard now so we have unhealthy treats some lollies chocolate bars this is like a real insight into might this is essentially the really unhealthy cupboard guide this is become probably director thought savory snack so we've got goldfish Marmite biscuits which can I just say are delicious some more kind of healthy so Chris some pizza favourite Pringles some breadsticks some salted pretzels and then I've stacked like this is like crisps goals of stats likes of crisps and care because you can just like grab them and go instead of trying to like delve inside of massive pockets we have Marmite flavour we have some vinegar flavor and you can tell I really like mum is then we've got the drinks but at least now you can see them so I've moved them from the bottom up to the top and they're easy to see basically I wanted to make everything that's covered easy to access and easy to see everything otherwise you just don't end up reaching for it and then in the bottom we've got cereals I do actually keep a lot of my cereals in jars but sometimes when the jars are full I just keep like leftover so I've got some leftover lucky charms in the cereal bars box but Coco Pops this is like half empty this is like here so is this one but I don't want to throw them away and once we start eating from the jar I can then top them up with bees got convex crunching up and then these are the more healthy snacks we've got some powerful a deliciously Ella Libya's kitchen bountiful raw gorilla monkeys like these are like if you want a healthy snack basically you go to this you go to this one and then these are breakfast bars I actually love these and there we go that is the cupboard reorganised and this is all the packaging that I didn't need listen to a bit mister boombastic I've got ma hello I'm Sean but I can't show him because he's got secret things just we were having it like laptop club time and I was going through my notebook and I found all the questions that I asked Jo and Alfie and a who knows me best Oh

"no_GARDENING WITH JOE SUGG AND TEAM JIM NIGHT OUT.txt"	"good morning everybody's a blob day so I'm actually running late and I've seen it in all my videos but I am this morning I usually wake up at 6:30 right and master my dog who's down there trying upstairs that's when she usually bark which woke me up this morning she barks at 5:30 really annoying so I went downstairs disorientated I sorted her out you know to grow our business and stuff and then I thought wait it's really early so in fact a bed for an hour and that's really ruin my life and now I'm sort of not really awake so there's a gym in throughout ten minutes you can put protein shake and then go I usually it was just me and Josh I filmed some of my sessions you see what I'm octave I'll do it fast this morning I'm not sure what class if it just text me last night thing it's a new class there's lots of people in the rooms I won't film it I'm sure that other people won't want to be on camera when they're looking all sweaty I don't mind personally other people are only more back to me so yeah quit protein shakes and then I'm going to head out well that was ranked the one that was we had a power of threeminute intervals with no three minutes is quite a long time for instance with no relation no there were 90 second intervals but you did two at each station to basically three minutes between exercises and no risk whatsoever is absolutely disgusting I am sweaty as you can see so we do things like if we're on the spin bike program foods that you do minimum half standing up like really high resistance need a mirror house printing a lowresistance and you move onto the treadmill do a similar thing then you do things like weights like squat jumps up basically it was just just horrendous but good way to start the morning I need a shower now and eat all the food in the world because that was like fullon also I forgot to threes I saw no me in the gym she basically in my gym you've seen it before but there's like the area where the classes are and outside that area there's like the yoga spot and to get from one fear the effort through so you wanna go to yoga sorted through the area I was it was the last of five minutes of the of the workout and I was dripping I think I was back on the spin bike for the second time and her and Joe who her boyfriend walked past hi oh my god hi composed is dripping but I actually went for for a drink when I made the other night she said I thought that your gym I really like it there and I'll probably I've been to you and what I'm expecting to bump into and I look like this and one other thing I know you're going to tell me off for vlogging whilst driving I'm not driving and part that's why my seatbelt on why I'm not moving I would never vlog and drive I just know that I'm sitting in the car with my camera out and I'm gonna get loads of comments can you keep doing that so I'm not doing that I hadn't got the cars my evening gear look it's in park trust me me again I just want to show you how I target at my parking space look if I go into reverse to get a reverse camera there's this Audi behind me here which is like I literally can't move backwards and in front of me this is Harley Davidson McCartney forward Ivor so I'm stuck what do I do oh yeah come in the office now and I've eaten enough shout out actually to try now is quarter to eleven so I've been up here for a while just kind of getting things done written a few emails paid a few bills that sort of stuff and now Daisy behind me editing a video well I'm in it now I am actually doing some writing so as you know I'm writing a book that's nearly finished and at the moment I'm kind of has a downed tools for a while because then it's gone to my editor the last time and we now just need to work out how I have to finish the book basically how I need to kind of make sure everything tied up nicely so it's with him so he'd having a good old look through and I'll go back through and I will have a look through myself and changing them to change you may remember a couple of weeks ago I wasn't a script writing course or a screenplay course and as you know I love film and I've always really liked the idea of creating one that never thought I could so and on of course and now I kind of know a bit more about it so I'm going to start writing a film on the course because it's a whole new language to me I you know I write quite a lot I write GQ I write my book as do other bits and bobs and but I am NOT like educated in it you know I mean I didn't do English at university so it is kind of a new term that people use quite new to me so I went on this course where the guys would roll at McKee who is writing the script writing allegedly look on a script doctor you know basically if someone writes a film and it's goods were not great to look over it and he'll change things and make it better but he's got so many years of experience but 77 years old or something so what'd I miss bored a call from I loved so much and I took sixty pages of notes for the last two weeks I've actually when I've had a chart been going through my notes and writing them out because that's these are my notes here been racking them out and neater and this lovely little notebook I bought here to kind of make it more of a things going my Bibles I'm going to turn to this come whenever I am writing something so I'm going to do now hopefully do the last 15 pages notes write them all out nicely and then I have a good long to think about what my feel about idea what I'm going to be I had a good long think about kind of how it all played out and stuff and they take a long time to write and I'm not expecting my first one to go anywhere because people write 10 15 20 before anyone is even interested so you know I don't think I'm not gonna be brewing that at first time either it'll take a while to get better but I really want to do it I'm the more the older I get the more film is important to me as long as you know I used to do like lots of premieres and host things on red carpet and I work a lot with films on my channel so you know I go on little trips and film storage I just love the movies so being able to kind of have them guys don't want to go to the wicket so yeah because they're new thing I do might take a while and imagine it's going to be years and years and years before I might actually get to watch what I do if anyone ever goes watch what I do but I'm going to do it anyways because I want to so that's not going to do right now hey sorry just got my camera and you've wandered off come back don't play hard to get come back here oh okay bye then so I've been sat at my desk now for hours the time is 10 to I've got the window open it's actually nice weather for the first time in what 2 week that we had quite a nice weekend ish otherwise one's been pretty appalling lately considering it's May but yeah but windows open in the nice breathing I've done a little bit stircrazy because I've been sat at my desk ages now and writing me notes I'm finding it really helpful because going over again kind of really am cement knowledge in my head but soon I've got a photo shoot just so going to be there too so I get that then the next time I talk to you I've got to be there in an hour and 10 minutes luckily the studio is just around the corner from I have like literally like a four minute walk from my house which I get so yeah bit more writing then photo shoot there is what also profile that man has so I don't know if I'm actually allowed to talk about what would fit what we're doing here yet or not we're getting clarity on that if we're not that to talk about I'm going to blur out Joe's tshirt who is it Brown warehouse this is my main place addresses just make it very straight home from videos we're both doing this thing and trying to book it in so we could do it together in fact we've just sort of being few days after this oh yeah Joe wanted to

English through her translator I saw God it was gonna be really awkward how are we gonna chat and it was so great we learned so much about the brand that I didn't know and so much about like the ethical side of the brand and how all their like lavender fields and how how they're like really struggling with global warming and all the different things that trying to do to protect it he basically started the brown when he was like 23 just because the area provancha we're in now was a really poor area at the time and he wanted to kind of create work in the area and I give back and to see like what it's all become and this hotel in the area is amazing and how that global the brand is now we were just chatting about so many different things I didn't realize it looks kinda like one of the only brands that has Grail on their products so that blind people can like know what the different products are I think that's amazing and apparently is so so expensive to do but they don't make the product more expensive because of it if I take it out pay for themselves and just all these different like really interesting facts I didn't know about lots of town I was very inspired me know me and Anna would literally like I mean we were like three rows days down just like staring at him like wow it was so cool dinner was lovely too I made the mistake of having pasta and I feel like

feel you like cheese boards I'm not a cheese lover myself personally so no you will never find me in a restaurant ordering the cheese would you rather be trapped in a mansion for a psychopath or in a fun house full of killer klowns the wait why I mean I'm gonna die either way right I think that's a cincture you're gonna die I think I'd rather die from from clowns because a slight path you can tell

saturday is because it's like you have your whole weekend you have your day of fun and then at the end of that you're like yes I've still got some day as well unless you work on something which i use

"no_Having a Permanent Blow Dry  Lily Pebbles Vlog.txt"	"good morning it's Tuesday today I didn't end up vlogging yesterday because we just went to the beach and sat there for the entire day and did nothing else but at lunch bit of bat and ball and I was about it so I decided there wasn't much to vlog today is our last day we fly home tonight which is sad but it feels like we've been here for weeks I think when you go somewhere familiar that happens because you don't need time to settle in so we're going to go I think now to old Antibes and go to a food market buy some yummy food make lunch at home and then we might head to nice this afternoon because we're flying from nice and haven't been there since I was really little get video remember what it's like so we thought we might go there for dinner which could be nice so we're just going to go pick up some food for lunch that place had glutenfree pancakes with Nutella and they were so good we're just in the food market picking up some melon Parma ham fix tomorrow's to make the black for lunch before we head home and make lunch we've come to Allah to you to have a little drink and this is a really nice free beach a lot of beaches on here are private this is a really nice free Beach so I thought sure you quickly what we got from the market melons in here some amazing cherry tomatoes is it delicious I'm now going to quickly do a bit of work outside on the patio what time is it hey how do you know I remember yeah tomatoes avocado melon salami Parma ham pigs cherries artichoke because scratcher with almond in sounds weird goats cheese this is literally my perfect lunch rose' and French bread which I'm not allowed to eat and that's everything I think all that food and listen to some kind of food coma cuz we were ended up having naps but you nothing what were you doing in the room rich reading okay I'm exhausted I just woke up and I won't be hydrated I think I'm going to grab a quick shower and then pack and then we're probably going to hit two nice there's time to leave the flat we're all packed up and we're going to head to nice for an early dinner this is the painting that we bought we're going to take this on the clip that is actually the painting this is what we're good on a wall now joking it's all rolled up yet to take off the canvas for us we have to stretch it when we get home if he now knows anywhere in London that does canvas stretching and puts back on for you because I don't really know all our pieces are ready to go let's take them into the car we're now in Nice and we're trying to find somewhere some quick tin and we have to go to the airport how could I come to knees and not pop into Sephora I bought this from makeup forever the hydrating primer quite a sight even conceived of Nexus red the airport it is called our flight okay we're heading onto the plane and if you ever don't go very dark Oh comes up okay it's gonna be really quick flight home and then it's gonna be really late I'm not going to go to bed too late 1/ 1 which is comparable personal fault get on the plane and use snack then we're back in London we made it in one piece that flight was actually fine quite durable add tomato juice Maltesers and Pringles and we watched like four episode emphasis of Entourage there was quite a lot of turbulence fingernail boxes squeezing so tight we're gonna head homes like midnight I sure hope it's not home yet I watched yet it's half 11 o'clock tomorrow so when they said it was hot in London they weren't lying it's going to be degrees later on this afternoon which is crazy for when you're in like this busy city with cars and pollution it's all a bit a bit much my room is so hot if I opened all the windows it's ridiculous I'm just getting ready and I don't

going to her since today take my hair done I just wanted to show you guys this and become a little bit in love with this it's new from YSL don't think about yet it's called the sunkissed blur Perfector it's basically a cream bronzer and I have the shade Sahara in I think maybe they'll called that I'm not sure which so it's kind of like a ready brown um which is a good because it's kind of my natural tan color I love this so much I was using a holiday my mom actually went and bought one in Sephora when we were in Nice and I thought I'd show you how I like to apply it I think it's really nice to give like a natural sunkissed look so what I do is I use the Real Techniques contour brush and just dab it into the very very creamy and then I just kind of Pat it along the tops of my cheekbones where I would get a suntan pull it all the way across my eyes in the other cheek and then I also put it up towards my hairline it's so so nice when this comes out not sure when I'll find out um I really really recommend it it's great ok just taking Dixie out for a really quick walk before we start our day and I think the kids are here so they're going to come with and he's wearing a

I've had the lingual braces on for anyone that doesn't know that does means like the train track braces but on the back of the teeth so if you can imagine like sometimes it's not overly comfortable it gave me a bit of a lisp I mean I still have a little bit of a lisp but I think I've always got that I'm very happy to get over that doesn't bother me in the slightest yeah but I finally had the bottom braces and taken off which means that technically my treatment is pretty much complete I kind of glazed over yes like oh I'm really happy but I can't even explain to you just how great that feels to finally have them off after months so I'm just absolutely thrilled than you guys are looking to get like any dental work done any dental treatments then also I would have I never realized just how bad

mentioned this but me and rich hopefully hopefully moving to our own place soon these sort of things take so long though it's been in the works since februari and it still not really confirmed to I

sheets and we're desperate to know what meet it was just we really husband in every way we're now heading into the kitchen to make sure the mushroom yeah I don't like to put mushrooms yeah business right walk mushrooms vegetables laughs it was dark I got that right I won't let me be the spell out of purchase we had such a nice evening that was really lovely did you guys have a nice time maybe it amazing uh yeah good Rob rich nice time good time had by all now to head home for a good stuff good morning today is a mainly a stay at home and do some work day I was out yesterday here my face I without yesterday afternoon so I need to do a bit of filming today Phil mean a very exciting announcement video which I think should have gone up by now I won't say just in case it hasn't but I think it went up yesterday so go and check that out if it's already up and I'm going to film a first impressions video that's going up on Thursday then i'm going to edit both of those and i'm going to do some blog posts and tonight I'm going out so I'm going to vlog today it's really not an interesting data vlog but i'm going back to suffolk for the weekend which is a riches farm for his sister's birthday and i won't really want to vlog that so today is kind of the only other day to vlog this week hasn't been the most exciting week but i know you guys don't really mind okay the first thing I need to do is sort out this hair of mine um it's definitely much easier to straighten in the morning I've had my Brazilian blow dry but I still need to do it because otherwise it looks like let me get it down for you this is what it looks like so it's still obviously kinky and like a little bit frizzy I normally just kind of straighten it and then put a bit of curl in it so I'm going to sit here with my straighteners and my iPad this is normally when i watch youtube videos I was just watching James Corden take a break I love the James Corden youtube channel for the late late show and the take a break segment is just my favorites hilarious and you just put up a new one it was so good I'm gonna stop filming and I just feel in my bedroom now I used to kind of worried more about backdrops and stuff but at the moment it's not really priority for me I'm just worried more about not worried but not concerned thinking more about the content rather than the background because I haven't really got any one particularly nice to film in this house so I'm just gonna forget about that sound it's just setting up my camera I'm gonna have like one light just on the side because i think the the circle in the eye thing can get a little bit and also it means the lights quite close to your face which i think when with makeup tutorials can kind of change the color of the makeup so this is very very simple oldschool setup and i think i'm just going to get started just in case you've ever wondered how the pros do it it's in tracksuit bottoms using dirty washing basket as a table yeah finished video 1 and that was really fun Ashley it's like a first impressions video and I don't do those that often and it's kind of fun to have no plan and just talk user now I need to film my announcement video which I'm probably just going to do on this camera I'm really moving today finally got my sight back since I go back from LA I've just like wanted to eat pasta at weird times of the day and so I just went to pick up some sushi for riches working from home so what's on for hand and my sister who works from here we will work from like the same house I got cucumber maki salmon and avocado and spicy tuna I'm just editing the first impressions video that I just filmed I'm wearing my glasses because I'm really my life that's terrible these days with Roman I can't really see and believe in my old glasses so they probably don't even see me anymore but they're the ones that are on my desk okay it's a little bit later now I've been working all afternoon and I've actually been quite productive although I've made a massive mess in my office I really need to tidy up later but now I'm going to the Opera I'm going with rich and my mom my best friend Jake he probably seen in my vlogs is a professional opera singer and he's in a show tonight I don't know what it is I think it's like handle I don't really know much about for only really like opera when he's in it if I'm honest but he's a countertenor so he's got a really high voice I think I once snapchatted him singing everyone was like what so that we really fun i love seeing him saying he's not really in London that often these days so that would be really nice and it's in town I think it's at the Royal College of Music unless I'm getting all of this wrong I'm pretty sure it is like opposite the royal albert hall just wearing my top shop which I don't want your nakedness behind topshop top and made wild necklace chopchop trousers all black because it really now smart it is and black safe I just saw on Twitter this international friendship day and see it isn't going to see Jake in his opera and we've known each other our whole lives 27 years to me 28 years for him I just found this vote on my phone and I had to put on Instagram because it's just so funny well why we were a matching outfit and we have one of those necklaces it's like a hot split down the middle and oh my god both of our teeth are just terrible I just realized what I said about the whole 27 years for me 28 years with him thing just doesn't make sense at all because the year of that friendship I wasn't alive so just ignore my stupidity going to try and go to cock tile ebony because i love the aubergine tagine I'm back home now and I've got my cup of tea and my biscuits so I'm happy and it was really nice to see Jake in his opera I mean he's be seen since he was five so I've seen him in all different kinds of things and he used to like have like one line and I'd see the whole thing and he just been like a tiny bit and this he was the main part he was like the king and it was so nice to see him have such a big part and he had like a really angry seen that was really good and he got a huge applause is that the word I'm thinking off at the end everyone was I whoo like you definitely ought the biggest ones I was a very proud friend and yeah he's amazing now what he does so that was nice although opera is not really my thing it's nice to see him sing and I love his voice so that's all for this vlog I'm gonna leave it here because as i said i'm going back to suffolk this weekend and yeah that's all I've got a what oh yeah I said that like suffix my home is not yours on Thursday I have a first impressions video for one of the products that i bought wales in LA so hopefully you guys were like that and that is all goodnight"	2622
"no_HORROR MOVIE NIGHT.txt"	"this camera just doesn't want to work today is this camera better quality I think I might try and vlog on this camera today it is a ton bigger it is the camera that I filmed my main channels on also the camera that I from my gaming videos on but I might try it out looking back over there it's just not working it's not it's not doing it's not doing good today look at that come wide that is anyways good morning guys how are you doing how are you today I hope you having a lovely day wherever you are in the world today I show you this little thing that arrived at my office well it's not you very little or say little things they're not little it's quite cool just to like hang clothes and shoes and stuff like that one anyways delet in my office because I'm finally receiving a sofa the sofa is going to go also thank you so much will despawn yes to this video it means a lot to me the sofa is going to go over here and it's going to help for my gaming videos because it means that I can set up things like my Xbox and Playstation all of that and I can functional gaming videos on there for you whilst I wait for this sofa papi Zoe and Mark are in The Breakfast Club which is a delicious kind of it is a restaurant a cafe I guess it's a restaurant it's open from 8 a.m. to p.m. so kind of counts as a restaurant more than a cap own guessing anyway as they are in the breakfast club having some breakfast hopefully not having some breakfast because I said please can you wait for me we just arrived now in town they've gone off to go grab some coffees and some drinks and the Breakfast Club hopefully they're not going to order until I get there and then I'm gonna have breakfast with them my surface should be here any second alright so basic so basically my setup that I'm looking at so far today is just this it is this big old camera here it's called a 70 day Oh someone's ringing my mobile hello oh no I didn't see them okay let me quickly have a look now loud texture is basically it's a 70d so autofocuses and then I've got a sigma 10 to millimeter lens next super wide and let's try and find something for me to put it on because a lot of vloggers like KC nice tat vlogs with it on one of these which is absolutely amazing but they're incredibly heavy because it's metal obviously it's not heavy like just to pick up if you're holding it all day vlogging all day on it so heavy old boy this one is like a lighter smaller version I could try puttin on that could try putting it on this which might rework this is from Manfrotto it's quite cool got like this there's not really much else I could put it on nothing else here is like tripod eh let's try this okay I'm going to screw it into the bottom and see if it works so stable now hmm it's a little bit wobbly nice because that does work that worked really well that's so comfortable oh my gosh this is that so good luck it's like a tiny little handle underneath the camera I'm going to start rigging on this and then if I need you like just say for now for example if I want to put you guys down here I can just put you guys down open the legs and it stands up by itself this is like the best thing ever I am so glad although it is going to be a big difference it's going to be a lot different to vlogging on a little camera that can just pop in my pocket because this is a big old camera I'm going to try vlogging on this setup today let me know if you think the camera is better quality wise quality for some reason the audio isn't as good you don't like how wobbly it is or how sumed or how unzoom door I don't know let me know completely what you think and this could potentially be my new vlogging camera look a world in this dog if it's just sitting there waiting for us owner oh my gosh oh my gosh people couldn't carry the sofa no weren't strong enough and then it helped our they were then together we're gonna get cheeky everything my god it's all sorted now the sofa is in my office I'll show you in a minute I haven't even seen it yet and now I'm just gonna go grab breakfast from The Breakfast Club you guys have all finished and I haven't even started yet these two obsessed with the different snapchat filters of switching faces literally entire breakfast bill cider holy crap look outside guys literally when I left a minute ago you just saw me running along and it was so sunny that's crazy let's go outside let's go oh let's go on go go oh my god I nearly fell over yeah don't go outside now so cold straight down my back we get a bitch bro it's so slippery and what I don't even know if you guys can see what's happened now my camera is going to break it so where oh my gosh look at it today so sharpies here we go I think posture is going to be the one guys apparently you can draw on skateboards you can draw on watering cans then draw on CD players on carpets uncheck on anything so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab with some white ones and grab some silver ones today last long yeah they do as long as you sort take her to keep the keep the end on yeah you've got my pens I'll tell you guys what they're for later on tonight or tomorrow once again and I'm just heading back to the office need to go I need to go edit my daily vlog I need to get my daily vlog up so then it's not late for you guys man but there's my sofa I feel like I need to skateboard or something put the legs on there for it could just wheel it across but surprisingly a skateboard is one thing that I don't actually have in this office however Apple I meant to get it through this door we're going to someone pick it up and put on its side which starts looking good now guys so I've got my computer gaming setup here term gaming videos and just that's just the background for now obviously it's going to be changed and then over here Israel I'm going to sit on there like this to film console gaming videos like Playstations over that and then I'm going to put a TV here but my TV is currently at home I need to bring over I've lost the stand which is not helpful because it's currently on the wall in my old office and I want to put it here unlike a unit my new videos just saving and the time is only it's going to be up on time today I've got a one brick wall here obviously fake I'm going to try and hang it up on there the background some gaming videos I've also got a load of little clips maybe I don't need it that big this is pretty damn wine the only thing I've got to cut it is this I've got to be careful okay you're ready to see what I've created it's very it doesn't look very good I'm probably not going to use it I'm probably just going to vote green screen there instead it just it just won't go like tighten up to make it look like a brick wall like the lights just going to give away that it's fake so I mean I'm not trying to pretend to like make you believe that it is a brick wall but I want it to look like it's a brick wall and that it's just too saggy to look like a brick wall my new vlog has been stuck on 52% uploading for the last 45 minutes usually when I upload a video literally takes like six minutes minutes left 52 percent I have no idea what to do do I like walk up to town with my laptop and try to upload it sneaky from the Apple store on their WiFi it's quarter to 3:00 in the afternoon my video has to be live by 5:00 so I'm going to film a new gaming video now and if it still is on 53% after I finished this gaming video I'm just going to got into town and upload it in a cafe somewhere I've just finished up filming the new gaming video it was incredibly short but also quite scary I hope you're gonna enjoy that when I upload it it's just saving and doing all the bits now on the video and the audio separately and stuff let's check like I honestly haven't checked how my upload is going like 55% okay so it's gone up 2% and now it's just 78 minutes one hour 20 minutes later I am finished with my video and my uploaded still at 58% so it's gone up a little bit and now it says minutes can't handle it gonna go up to town weather oh my gosh by min fo store let's see what their WiFi is looking like okay we're looking good processing we can go thank you so much Apple they're being lovely as always thank you so much I need to get used to this camera it's so bloomin big that it scares me blogging in public and vlogging in public is one thing that I love doing if you've been watching these videos for longer than one day and I'm running for the stairs you will know that I love to blogging God get me check it off you will know that I love the vlog in public but this camera is so damn big that it kind of just puts me off like everyone just stares at me like look at it in the mirror this is wrong way from with look at the size of that in there look at you look at the size of you and I'm walking down the street like hey God I just bought my sushi which I was richer to get to do hopefully if you do like this camera then you do like me using it I will get used to it and I won't mind blogging the public with a big old camera like this right the video is up I've got my

Skype call it went incredibly well now I need to eat my sushi that I bought I just bought some California roll I've already eaten the chicken teriyaki and then I've also got is it salmon rice bean teriyaki I don't even know I have no idea and then I just downloaded a new gaming video while stars in the meeting on skype on Steam and now I'm going to record myself playing that to go up on my game channel over the next couple of days I'm still getting used to this camper I don't know if I like I kind of I think I kind of like it like serious wounded and then a white that is yo I mean I'm gonna get used to it you guys are gonna have to see what if everything like that that I think it's cool I just left them this look so wide there we go I have just left the office now everybody I didn't

for you all right genic is a bit under the weather today I'm trying to get ready I've managed to get bit of makeup on and it's really hard to dress today because I don't know if it's going to be really hot it looks quite cold out there at the moment I know I'm going to get in teheran I'm going to be sweating I've got the pram to push such a dynamic so I'm in my success denim e shirt dressing from and all I'm going to take a cake with me it's all finally interesting isn't it fascinating fact of the week I've realized that my Marc Jacobs winter parka has removed maligning and so I have made

we're sort of failing at summer smokey eye with cruises where odds on the title of this one because I think a half smokey eye would be more mysterious and people be like or what's that you can look how hot it is outside this is a view out of the this window looks like runs on sort of running track hey don't any marks yeah Oh what am I saying I don't know just something funny try and be funny we are so hot at me I literally have sweat running in rivulet down my cleavage and yeah well you want me to be funny act like but I was joking on the other way I'm I'm you gone the other way sad to do this this is my mute Carolina ban she's really good at makeup she's not so hot on this being very funny yes so make sure you tune in for those videos that we're doing I'm going look at Caroline's videos on Instagram this she can really embarrass this because every summer pinch me I'd like to go to Croatia which is but they are really amazing they're my favorite thing my anger rose it is started clear balancing isn't it it's like one of those people you know like if you had a really keen date no like I really love you I love everything about you oh you're so pretty or you're so you know like just too many compliments all work plans are on hold for Emily because it's so nice and hot and then we have an extra nanny days day just by fluke which is good because and it's what it means I am actually getting some time in the Sun one thing that I was going to do today and that was them a car my hair is going to look a crazy look again and be do a lookbook and with some dresses I've got and today would be a good day suit because it's really my side but I did have a little bit too hot and too bright oh the irony so I might just use it you know he's as an excuse basically do nothing we are child bring the baby is with that money and Angelica is asleep so we are going to go and have sex in a layby we're not really he's broad daylight for goodness sake we're going to go for a walk in the woods see it's the first time we've ever been anywhere without both Olaf on it mister am I've had enough of me today he thinks I'm being silly about 7 o'clock this morning I gave him a whole list of all of my plans of the day which did his head in and now I just have had so many stupid conversations well I imagine the conversations acted him and he just sat there driving game mmm like that we should have I know that he really suited me mum is going to record a video oh it's very funny to be recording on my blanket so I feel bad lying here and not looking after a jelica she's been a pastor we've got our extra in any day which is amazing and I don't feel bad enough to get out I mean like literally she's right there fucking got even get involved like now I'm on strike oh this tell you normally I'd be racing to get a million pieces of work done to make use of my day and but no I'm just I've decided I'm on strike this weather's amazing that's it one day holiday to be fair I've only done about two hours off of cure indulgent relaxation that actually I think 50 bad crawled inside my belly button and uh uh I've been testing out these SPF phrase this week because it's been hot this one runs from the negara both SPF 50 and they're really really fine mist now I have to say I don't it mistakes on my face what I think about these me because they're brilliant idea and people have always asked me what do you do if you've got your makeup on and you just want to top up your sun protection to sort of incidental exposure or you know if you're out in the Sun and you feel like you don't have enough protection on you don't want to take all your makeup off and put your SPF one and then put it all on again so these are brilliant for that however what I would say is I don't think that they provide the same protection they do say SPF 50 however for the way that you would apply them which is just a quick sort of spritz or mist is how I would have thought you would do it I don't think that you would get the protection that you would get from applying a layer of cream you know like properly so yeah a really good idea for people that want to topup during the day I think they're great but use a proper SPF that's not processed yet but you know a traditional sort of cream or fluid or something like that I did a bit of a more scientific test this isn't just my opinion I have actually been testing these out and I did a proper sort of kids 56 one on my shoulders which haven't burned at all and I just use mist on my chest area with no such a base layer of SPF and I did catch some quite badly on here and in the same amount of time that I didn't things happens on my shoulder pool so I think that reaffirms my point and I think they're a brilliant brilliant product and I will do a review on them and they sit beautifully on this skin there's no white nurses nose which is greasing us or anything like that oh but yeah I just be careful because I think to get your full whack out of them you'd have to be there go Shh age of majors majors anywhere age of little beauty seemed interlude er gee look at mr. bass please prepare for the window or anything no one's looking oh my God he's so funny I'm going to finish my clock here I think I'm doing some quite interesting things over the bank holiday weekend I wonder at this tonight because mr. AMR is going to a birthday party at the local pub and I'm going to have a night in perhaps or dominoes woohoo and edit videos so that's what I'm going to do and hopefully if I have time I'm going to edit a video for my other channel the uphill and because I filmed a whole day in the life video of having two hundred twos or a newborn and a toddler I filmed about a month ago and I just haven't got around to editing it so I shall link to that at the end if it's up if it's not up go and subscribe to that channel and then you'll get something when it does go up but hopefully I'll get basis and done tonight and then you can watch them you watch the other one straight after this hopefully it will sort of appear on the screen somewhere if I get my act together but I hope you've enjoyed that because I haven't done a vlog in a while I'm going to end here because I just feel like I'm on a really happy roll today has been amazing I've just done no work apart from filming this doesn't really work and I had loads to do and I just sucked it all off and decided to sit around in the garden and it's just been absolutely brilliant so hopefully you enjoyed it and I shall see you next time"	2330
"no_HOW NOT TO FLIRT WITH GIRLS....txt"	"where's mommy where's mommy I think she's found ya did you find there oh did you find her oh my gosh someone's excited can't you see good morning guys good morning whoa Matt the Rope how you doing I'm actually off to the gym today believe it or not not off to this gym this gym is not ready yet so I'm off to meet my mate max and work out with him just which I'm super excited for oh that's a great angle Oh even better it's Monday morning it's 7:00 a.m. getting up early getting my butt to the gym before my first meeting this morning at 10:00 and then I know actually my first meeting today is at 12 o'clock I've got the chilled morning well though I'm going to edit the road before that so basically I'm hitting the gym now then I'm going to edit the road then I'm going straight into it eight hey today it's going to be good today's I can feel it the weather is amazing I feel good I've had a coffee I've had a banana off to the gym today it's gonna be a good day it's Monday it's Monday that's one of my favorite days of the week guys this is so sick oh I know they've all gone there was month to order their babies and brands do not fitness class running around the track with the plans good gym session this morning I'm very wary that I haven't worked out in a long time like literally probably four months maybe even more than that so I was quite quite cautious about Aitken too much tomorrow if we do one specific body part so we just did a little bit of everything just finished having breakfast which was leftovers from yesterday's dinner if he saw so he made a delicious chickpea and sausage and tomato like dish so had some of that for breakfast and and now I'm just trying to edit the vlog as quickly as I possibly can because I've got a meeting this starts in 44 minutes very very far away like long head away trying to get as much done as possible but I'm also very where that need to get dressed in everything as well but I will not be late today I've gone for the detail the little tiny detail I never normally pay attention to I wear too much but today I've gotten sneaky so on the back of my tshirt I mean jumper don't if you can dunno how gonna be sure you oh can you see that without my tshirt I think why don't and then I've matched that pink writing of little trim of pink on my socks I'm sorry I'll come back later trampoline I don't have time today for a morning backflip this meeting I need to get to it's too important and I cannot be late I don't have a little tripod set up thing for the camera in this car so I will catch you I'll see you there I am the savage at parking like honestly I know I say this a lot and I specially say this when I park here I used to sucker pocket like I find it really really difficult but over the last couple of months I've become the king what I need to do is remember to pay on this machine now actually my music depend my phone if they got that ya pay by phone last time I was here I completely forgot to pay and I got a parking ticket just completely forgot six pounds forty five that is way cheaper than a 25 pound parking ticket look at that weather guys the sky the weather the vibes the atmosphere the fresh sea air I told you today was going to be a good day I could just fairly I know that so this meeting that I'm jumping into now could potentially run for like four hours or it could run just for a couple of hours I've told you guys again and again in the videos that there is a big event happening in Birmingham I was going to say next month is actually this month called hello world this meeting is to finalize so I'm super less because per new braces in yesterday this is to finalize some of the cool things cool features call parts activities going on at the event we're finalizing some of them today man that was awesome that was really really good guys I haven't got a parking ticket I am so happy my meeting ran over so long I wanted to be done by like o'clock it is now 17 minutes past 3: and I haven't even finished editing the vlog yet test scores to be up at 5: when I can't really keep some focuses on this face rather than my face by the vlog is finally all up what was scheduled I managed to edit it in the car and upload it hot spot in my phone internet whilst in the car now just heading into town finally to get Zoey on Wednesday yes or his fifth anniversary five years but that is insane I'm only 24 and the last five years the most important last five years of my life they must bought last I've been the most important have been spent with Zoey how mad is that but time is just gone I'm in Wenzhou if he wasn't even a thing where he wasn't even a thing online when you guys used to try fine little sneaky bits in blogs of us like holding hands or slightly touching each other's legs I deliver known and that I spent five years well on Wednesday will be I think I've found I can't speak about too much in the vlog because this goes up tomorrow which is Tuesday yeah just wait see awesome thank you so I always do this thing and I know you can't even see me I'm doing a hard imbalance Mike ah there we go balancing you're on a pack of minutes so I'm naturally just a very chatty person as you can tell from making these videos and often these videos have long chatty segments where it's just me sitting down like I am right now I suppose just talking and talking to again basically I just love to chat and this isn't just on camera this is off camera as well people that know me personally will know this every time I go into a coffee shop or getting a train ticket or anywhere where there's a way to interact with I don't if I'm ordering a drink in a pub if I'm buying a card just now for Zoey I just I just chat to the people just now in bagelman and this happened the other day in a pub I was literally in a meeting in a pub and again just like now inveigle man the woman behind the tail the girl in both these situations young girl like my age thinks that I'm flirting with her because I'm just being so overly chatty and I can understand why they would probably assume that because I'm just chatting chatting too long my camera ran out of memory suggest now make a man it got to the point where I felt like I had to and I did I said oh I'm not really sure whether I want ketchup or brown sauce on that one because it's for my girlfriend she's at home and I haven't asked her it's it's her lunch because I felt that it was so awkward that she thought I was flirting with her I was like again I'm throwing the card out there I've got a girlfriend I'm not trying to flirt I just thought I'd sit down and see if any of you guys have the same issue now there's nothing wrong with like a boy flirting with a girl and she didn't know her had a girlfriend or not so it was fine but I did I'm not trying to flirt with people I just I just I just like I just like to chat and chat and chat like I don't know I don't know what it is I just like to talk to I think it's that I like to talk to strangers I'd like to talk to people that I'm genuinely interesting if they are having a nice day I'm interested to see how their works go and see and then now I just walk past so just remember now I just walk past another clothing shop and I buy clothes from that guy quite a lot and I literally walk past we both like acknowledge each other like oh hey man how's it going that I turned back around went in the shot past him how his day was going ask him how the business was going showed him my hoodie because he said who's this and I was talking about how it's Elvis Presley past him how the week's been the fact that on the weekend it was super busy because it was a payday weekend and now it's gonna be quieter because it's Monday and the week last week was pay week and I wasn't even shopping in the shop I'm busy I've got I've got things to be doing but I just walked back to go and chat but I just like chatting to people that's one thing that I've realized over the last couple of months is that I chat a lot more a lot more than the average person and actually thinking about it in school I was always really really wellbehaved but the one thing that I used to get every single at parent is it called a parent review teaching a teacher parent review kind of thing like you know when your parents come in or your your guardians and they have a chat with the teacher and see how you go in and what you can improve myself like that mine was always like Alphaeus absolutely amazing doing really really well except for me just chats it just chats to everybody in the class we try and move him for chatting too much in another place and then he just makes friends with that person and just chats with them so it should have really known it was coming to be honest just thought I'd mention it the vlog because I want to see if anybody funny if anybody has any tips or if anybody feels the same as me or is the same I don't know any wasn't need to get back on oh she's so sleepy put your present close your eyes put your hands out I sort of always getting you presents guess what it is first carny trying to balance you on a squash it's 6:03 604 in the evening just sit down for my lunch now today has been blooming busy today's been good though it's been really good I'm gonna start doing YouTube live shows again so I think we're gonna try and kick start that off tonight I've also got a meeting at 8: so could be perfect to eat this then do a live show then huh my last meeting of the day and then have dinner and just chill you know what time it is you know exactly what time it is I know you know what time it is and I haven't got a necklace on today so I can do it I told you this morning that I would do it oh no if I fall and break my neck I blame it on the morning backflip even that's not the morning anymore just finished my first youtube live show in ages and it reminds me how much I love the live interaction like the reason why I love vlogging the reason why I love doing over this is not obviously just to document my life to watch your back and everything but it's the the instant feedback is such a different feedback from like well now you stop load and pointlessblog the comments and the replies everything I got were about the video and we're just about like oh that was funny or when you did this that was funny like the comments on these videos are so they're so different it's about my life as a homeless about me and my family and my friends and I love it I can read them every single day the next day because I upload these videos every single day when you're live I can say something and you guys like instantly respond it's just awesome like it's so simple so it sounds like all my stupid saying yeah but there is just something about being live I'm even able to be like look at this and just show you that straight up because this is pretty live like this is like 24 hours behind which is actually pretty uptodate like if you're watching TV shows they're like six or eight months out of date kind of thing anyway so I've got one minute it's currently 14 minutes past 8:00 I've got one minute till I'm jumping on a phone call with a dude in New York who is a crazy entrepreneur businessman called Gary Vaynerchuk I wanted to chat to him for a while because he's like in this space in this YouTube world he daily vlogs he owns a wine business he was an early investor in tons of different super successful companies and were jumping on the phone in one minute to chat about the future what we're both up to we haven't really planned too much we've never spoken before we've just been messaging on Instagram DM and we're going to jump on the phone and have a chat see what he's up to see what I'm up to see if there's any way to work together I've got my notepad and pen I'm in the idiot I'm an idiot I'm just blinking at the time it's not 20 minutes past I it's five minutes late this does not he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who's gonna be five minutes late and then I just googled the time in New York got the time gone it's actually 9:15 nor 8:15 UK time I did the time difference wrong between New York and England GMT not BST or whatever it is basically I've got got wait another hour which is organic means I can go home and start eating my dinner it's 12 minutes past 9:00 so a couple of minutes to the call just ate my dinner don't know if I showed you and then if I filmed that at all the Lighting's much better this way for the vlog there we go yeah earlier on when I was in town I went to this veggie place and got a takeaway meal for tonight and it was so good hey how's it going I'm very good and very good I'm just connecting you to some air pods just quickly so I started YouTube back in 2009 just like straight up in my bedroom family holiday camera messing about putting on a stack of books nobody knew I was making videos I didn't want to tell friends because YouTube was weird back there and it wasn't popular it wasn't cool supersuccessful time on the phone with Gary we've arranged a dinner and drinks together in London on Thursdays flying

we're British but I've always done it since coming to LA literally every person you look at you assume it's someone so the amount of times we've gone to each other there was this one guy yesterday we're at the Griffith Observatory he was like looked maybe 1% like Kanye West and I was like oh my god Matt looks like Kanye West and then that looked at him and he's like is that Kanye right we realized this guy was about 50 times heavier than Kanye and had just like the slightest face similarity that's him Matt as well was just like I think that's Chloe grace Moretz as I actually it's a complete banged up I don't think she'd be driving around in a van car but it's like you just assume every person like oh who's that person who's that person I'm going on film with Connor in a minute we've got a couple of out or not in a minute what am I talking about got a couple of hours um Matt's biggest obsession is wanting to see laughs so excited it's gonna be amazing he's really keen for the Hollywood sign yeah so I'm gonna drive him up we're just gonna wing it and try and like going around and row just get as close we can and see it and he's probably gonna get really odd though yeah

"no_I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THIS CHANGE...txt"	"good morning good morning it's nice to see you here good morning good morning do you who else used to have to sing that in primary school every day I'm sure we got to sing it so if you're watching this do we have to do I'm sure we did like every morning is coed sake let's go good morning mrs. Hollingsworth good morning everyone like robots and sometimes I on a Friday better sing it good morning good morn morning it is Wednesday I am I've got much dangerous one second really bird yes Wednesday and you are right now wrong it's Wednesday and I am off to Brighton to go and see my sister Zoe we've got we've got a little ketchup and a bit of work to do together work on something this year I wonder where could be we worked on saying together this year which they hope you'll be out at the end of the year fingers crossed um yeah I'm going down to hers in a bit to go and hang out over see what she's up to and see what she's saying but first of all I can't be the smelly brother so I need to get the shower and get my life together basically for anyone that asked me Joe what is it that you put your hair to make it away is one of the main ingredients to having a good head of hair is this label MC sort spray I think I've already showed you this in a vlog I can't remember but either way I'm showing you again this stuff is still my favourite thing to put in my hair after a shower and your blowdryer and then it just makes 6 I have quite like I have a lot of hair this is quite thin I do definitely not have thick hair and this makes it just feel a bit more thicker oh there's so much like thing is that is complicated enough right I'm not gonna lie I'm not bad at flat pack stuff I can do it but leave it between previous instructions they're so complicated and look look all that home for Sanger lose most of that but all these little things here I'm going to lose all of them I just know I am so um I've got the stuff at the box which is a start but it's time it's gonna be difficult but I can't have got time to think about that now it's time to leave so I'm on the train and it turned out that to get a single to Brighton was about 24 pounds I think and to get two singles when it comes to 48 pounds and it's 45 pounds for a firstclass ticket so that world why not the first part of turn as well so like where's always go for the firstclass returns we did the first of turn and turns out like this is foot like this door here this these your table was our first class so what happens if like everyone bought a firstclass ticket on a wait sorry's not just these two yeah also get these two direction it's just secret chairs down here that and then ever see that's where the train driver lives how is that it's the smallest little area I've got this card game called a King's Cup or bring a fire I think if you're from the UK you could bring a fire if you're from America you call it King's Cup so it's multicultural which is great but what happens is you take you have a cup in the middle and if you get a king you pour some alcohol in for that mid that middle Cup and really gets the fourth king has to drink whatever's in the cup so it could be a mixture of anything and everything for example if it got this card here it says make a rule this will last the entirety of the game players must try to catch their fellows out Phillies comply to the designated rule means you drink so you got make a rule and then everyone try and so for example I could say you're not at a point so I so instead of pointing like this you have to point someone it said use your elbow like that that's a rule that I'd normally make or you can't say like first name so you always talk talk about using their surnames anyway that's this all game if you want to see me plays on like this on my channel with the boys and let me know it can be quite interest in on our way I'm wrong there is a massive difference between normal classroom first class or carpets a little bit nicer well it's been hoovered a little bit more that carpet isn't look as nice right yeah that's a nice carpet and you also get a little bigger a little bit of cloth right which is what I haven't seen one of these since like my nan has them on our chairs at home not from southern something rail but it's like you can see the seats down there they don't have it see absolute balling I just realized I got my passport on me still I don't really think you need to get a Brighton but you never know that bit crazy down there they have their there in special laws and ways or we get to press the magic firstclass button do you want to do it yeah okay you let you do the honors so Crowley first things first whenever I come to Berlin to see my sister I always go to the pasty shop or Cornwall to get a pasty a bloody little pasties this is a multipurpose capacity of his one it's gonna fill me up and to leave my hand warm it was quite cold and Brian taxis hey Zoe hi I bought your part but oh I know that's right still break hello no Alan sorry I bought you a gift but it's not I can use warm up for me what Jerry did do was just turn up with a pasty and not ask anyone else if they wanted a pasty I did I forgot to it yeah I should have I should have other very often got him a cool one cool pug one yeah I didn't say that she this is this but hey you gotta this is the funniest dog good one you didn't want to buy a deer yeah we having a good tug of war here I now see I get my camera right you just say you want to play anymore I'm not I'm not being me I'm just being honest and being honest good meeting give me your team oh it's hard to highfive when you can't see the next direct train is at 5:58 should we get you so it's been a very very quick trip but I've got really caught up with you at all no we've come here all the way for one meeting and now I'll go again I'm going back to London the reason I've got to go back my the other part of my scope was coming tomorrow morning they didn't deliver all my so far they're stupid like half of it figured T's is half it has come in next week Cheers can you come and stay with me soon please yes day as well oh good properly yeah okay I will do we will do anyway see you later easy lush nice boy all that by Allen nope okay maybe don't ya know maybe next time get oh this week because because show all this stuff blows blurs I've heard of mind the gap but all my word put on that you've lost a leg that was so odd there was like random snails just climb at that wall I don't know why but I just you know got you guys know that I realized snails so I felt like I had to bill I had to film here anyway I need a wee so bye um something's happened today and I don't quite know how to feel about it um some things just in why I shouldn't change and should always stay where they are if they can do and now things are got to adapt and change the times I don't know how I feel about this change something's changed today and it's it's really sort of affected me in a weird way I guess it's kind of like part of what I do but I just want I just kind of what I want your opinion what what do you think of this oh hello how do you feel about that this is instagrams new app logo I don't I I think thing is right I'm always so many struggle to change I don't like things changing and this is one of those things where I just it just now just seems too much like I think it's Instagram tamiri stood out compared to a lot of other apps that you see right now on my phone I feel like it's followed suit little bit with the other competitor apps and gone quite basic and futuristic he kind of just simple whereas I loved the old Instagram but loved the audience come logo because it was so different it looked like an oldschool camera which essentially is what it was most to be when it came out when they bought the first filters it was all about putting oldschool filters on new pictures combining old and new which is what people love that's why I've killed such a big market I think it's where appeal to all people was he people of all ages who loved old school photographs they loved it and I don't know I don't know the massive fan I mean I love Instagram but I just think I think it's just gonna have to grow it's gonna have to grow on me very very slowly it's in October on me anyway I'm hungry so let's sort something out for Jennison I'm doing up this for a long long time it's fine time to conquer my fears to face my fears and try and get this done it's you and me bedside cabinet and the aircon remote and the hairdryer but no natural not UV aircon remote just a hairdryer I don't think I probably need that but anyway let's do this okay first things first I've separated everything out into its own individual pile it makes things ten times easier to know that everything's in its own little individual pile anything is light it's like you need 30 sending me a screw thirty millimeter screws and millimeter screws and dolls through and all these different different types of screws screw this and sort out the pun but screw this this is complicated anyway I think I made a little bit simpler by doing like this so now let's go to our very very easy to use hand guide see how much wood Suresh plank of woods which plank of wood that's the hard bit because they've got numbers on them but in real life it up numbers on do they do they give a number on you know what I do that how do I know what number one how much miss guess what that is okay actually obviously the top bit isn't it because it's got it's where I'm confused it's gonna sound proper lame but already I'm enjoying this so much I could have been relatable hard you know what I CBA I'll get my dad to do it or pay someone to come and do it which you know I'm sure lucky would rather get something pays come and do it but I actually finds really therapeutic I prefer this to cooking these by the way are called cam locks which are my new favorite thing what they do is you put me in the wood and then at some point I'm gonna put a screwdriver in there and twist it and you can actually bring the wicked tightens the wood together and makes it neat if it's such a great invention I'm I'm being weird but I love cam locks it's my new favorite thing cam locks oh I've had a little mer I'm doing so well right but the metal bits on everything well there's something that's really bugging me I don't if it's like it should be annoying me or not bitch fucking me a lot so on here it says the screw I goes into that little hole there which is a circular hole and there's an oblong hole before it right before it to the right of it okay so I'm looking on here the circular hole is before the oblong hole on here so do I put the screw is tell me to put it in the top is the high spit which is this bit here but the screw fits this hole a lot better and I'm worried about everyone knows that you shouldn't drill screws in to close the edge of wood because it will make it split so do I put do I go with my instinct and put it in here and think that the guide is wrong or do I put it in here and just hope for the best because that's what it says in the book but in the book it's a circle at the top but in real life it's not so what do I do it's like it's turn is semi such mixed signals I got to FaceTime my dad oh look at this it's all started come together and listen to vintage my vintage old school players from Spotify which at the moment is tattooed I'm just tattoo all the things she said what a classic I'll leave a link in the description below to my Spotify profile where you can find this playlist coz it's absolutely amazing you're born the 90s you will love this playlist okay now they're scary but I've got a hammer net I've got use nails in a hammer this is where I break my freaking fingers right mr. hammer it's me and you against this we got this be careful right here we go that's one cabinet done and I just made the drawer as well and now it's the the best bit peeling off his protective film oh my god that is satisfying so when you get a new phone and you peel that thing off the screen oh yes oh but it's Dutch oh I'm doing the foot technique again look at my feet more than my hands a lot of time there we go first draw is in finally there we have it the drawers have been made I haven't put the handles on yet the handles are in there haven't put them on yet only because I need a drill to do it I haven't got a drill and my hands Oh knackered from constantly screw and screwdriver so yes I'm very very happy it looks great a slight problem though I think number one I think the sockets are a bit too high stalkers are higher than the top of the bedside cabinet look I don't if that's right or not I think I might have to get some to come in and lower the switches just a little bit just so you can't see them and number two that's one of two there's another one to get through right now and the time is ten past eleven I've just messed my dad asked him what he thinks about those plug sockets and he says the sockets are a health and safety regulation height believe it or not so technically health and safety wise you have to have legally after the light switches that high up there's got your work and sort disguise it or hide it or something I'm not sure how those go be away anyway enough of that round two let's get you ready water yeah he's ready it is done finished finito messy bed but I now have two bedside cabinets holy mother of Mary that's like when didn't a knee as long but I'm so glad it's done I'm still really light used to plug sockets but I'm gonna have to you know just ignore it I feel like it kind of blends with the bed well it matches the bed the colors Torgo meet with this wood here maybe not so much but with the bed I think it matches okay so next time hammer I'm going to put you back in your bed but you've been brilliant I love you nightnight sleep tight oh nice coming up 2025 past 1:00 in the morning so I'm gonna go to bed um but yeah it was really nice Caesar eat today even though it was for only a short while and we were talking about like secret stuff when done can see my sister I'm writing because we are working on something together we've been doing we've been trying work on stuff since I we've both kind of started YouTube I guess but this the stuff we're working on now is finally starting to properly come together and the secret projects were working on last year didn't quite work out and then looking back on it I'm kind of glad they didn't work out because compared to what we're working on now this is like nextlevel stuff compared to what we were going to release last year if that makes sense this is both Zoey and I are very very excited to be doing we do actually work with each other that often like we record videos we film videos together like every now and then but we've never actually probably like work linked together so this is very very exciting for me I can tell what with Zoila she's she's huge both something with the means to solve work on for a long time and so we are both very very excited to share it with you in I can't say when but hopefully it's this year it will be this year I can say that will be this year definitely this year and sooner this year than you think hopefully I hope you're excited for it to leave the clutch below what you think is gonna be I think it'd be quite surprised it might not be the most obvious thing you're thinking of that's what I'm gonna say or it might be we might not be that's what I'm trying to tell you I think I'm competing myself anyway I get end the vlog here I hope you enjoyed it if you did give it a big thumbs up and also if you haven't already click that subscribe button it's completely free and it lets you know when I upload new videos all the time so it's the easier way and then you

a win what yes some things can happen what do you think the winners who I said it think you've a will score first I think Robert will come back then you may we'll just finish more and one of the best attacks isn't in Real Madrid against the best defense I think I think all right they always score now what happened tonight I think we now don't get one I just want you to start for and get that as you go rather than just which we go and culminate I'm a Malby I make more interesting prospect if you go do get an early go over interesting because they're so good at defense they can stick up and I think I'm right in saying that's only monitor that scored against you very the Champions League this season in ou can play every other guards been from a dead ball whatever so give me a great point or two two champions of their division we don't always see arrive to the Champions League you don't always see people to win their league in the final box you may want to Syria and remedied one the La Liga so what a couple of finalists we have but they can only be one winner we are in and the roof is down the atmosphere is intimate take a look get down late finish Oh so I just nipped out a halftime quick update obviously if one or really what you've been hardpressed to find the first off of a match in a final those entertaining endtoend stuff lots of big types of going in I think that we could see a requirements going definitely consider happening I also think my earlier prediction of it going to extra time one or could obviously often as well maybe penalties that I know what a golf men do is absolute privilege to see that in the flesh parting about that and hopefully the stick a lot more the same still hoping you may win but we have another half of action like that I'll just be enjoying doing is the new key on it to get my fitness when is Gareth Bale coming on we won't fail I was doing right there playful at first it looks like a dragon instead of okay I don't live around monsters out because I was really still daughter taking off instead of wandered like November we pushed rapidly Rumble forever it was saved when the game like this 5 is 3 1 Kadena 10 men to revitalize now it over top for a happy and we've always had big of Champions League trophy in the process Banco since your youngster pitch the Gulf mother woman every time Oh everybody again first people ever to went backtoback champions Lee whoa well guys what the finals tell you what you don't often get five goals in Champions League final and a red card I said there to be a red card halftime but I didn't think it would come from substitute Padres oh not sure what he was thinking but going me I'm not a fan of what Ramos is doing there with the overexaggeration I love Ramos when my favorite players definitely my favorite defenders ever because I little pause personalities nothing to do annoy me but yes to say you're going to be super critical on it the rebels doesn't react the way did dance could rather get sent off I don't know if you danced so it does work what he does does what that's what makes it so annoying run it but hovering the Latin on since water partner it was unbelievable atmosphere to see that van to get overhead goal in the fish I don't think I'll ever forget that man gee I mean you don't get to see cows on there so that's the biggest scale of in see ya understood offenses you've a but you know what I'm happy with it one whenever showed up into the liver yeah hundred right after you gave the chance of thinking mattress fasting improves everyone might be standing probably going with a custom or blanket on thought yeah I think why not I think it's definitely going to balance all in the post already let's have a word about sedan by the way two years ago cuz then hadn't even managed a topflight team now he's probably one of the most successful management all time the only manager ever to go backtoback champions please no one's ever done that before I mean unbelievable we don't even go from here is there another job that you could even take the tire off your business around Madrid complete moving all the courts you need come have taken our calendar yeah that's the next job that is the next reform to be fair the only way you can improve from we're doing an Alfa unbelievable stuff here in Cardiff or call a pond or be take the BT sport for having us we've actually got invitation to Gareth Bale's bar now so we're gonna reduce it on the pitch so I think I'm millions and it quite on the bar and yes there he only got 10 minutes so he'll be have plenty of energy I'm sure cool yeah bit of run around in the blog with a very decent game I also had rude yeah I was rooting for you very well but having said that once you see the game you see the way it's played out it was a third goal that killed off you may was the first to a bit the flexure didn't they win Ronaldo got that one we need to find the defender made it free one game over and then of course the red card just sealed it so unlucky to you by do spare a fourth the bouffant he's a shame they didn't get that Champions League but I wake to go is there for him you know could be to be the ends of Groupon even if he's the end one of the best keepers of all time 100% so loyal to his club as well you know even when they had their moment when they went down and they got punished he stayed with them so why servants of football in general what on Buffon well dormitories Ronaldo gets a lot of critics but it's lived with a big stage again Messi coming for you Valens all records now

doing lots of research this morning onto not researcher sites but just making notes for future videos that I wanna film today you want to film two videos I think and perhaps put a date story which is one of the videos up this weekend so should be up by the time this video goes up actually I've also done there's some research on some vegetarian recipes for the week as well and that took a bit of time but at least I'm organized in what I'm getting for my food shop I'm gonna go and hopefully do this quite quickly and then I come back show you what I've got and then get filming outfit today is this kind of distressed like jumper from new look I wear this all the time I love it just a great tshirt and my new kind of shiny leggings from a source really comfortable old Primark studded shoes and Mike Atkinson shopping bag and my miss oh my necklace as well which a lot I just got home I'm gonna quickly show you what I just picked up bread tortilla wrap famous celery carrot garlic peppers sweet potato some fajita mix halloumi just in case I did get some chicken how did gets me he's a frozen so I'm not gonna even they're just for the days that I'm when I'm hungover I need some comfort food because happens quite a lot and I'm always like oh I just really fancy chicken nuggets or something just really likable yeah but because nobody's also run off our chicken Kushan so I'm gonna put them in the freezer but I'm gonna have some lunch now not being vegetarian today I got some right spit lentils some also I really keep fancying this stuff with the salad like a tomato spinach and also maybe some like feta salad so I'm gonna try this out at some point did get some salad onion coriander cheese and I also got some black beans because I really want to make that bean dip like is it for Joey or free only I'm just craving them all the time at the moment so I read a recipe today and the girl was like it's just so much better if you make them from school yourself soak them and then leave them to boil and then like mush them yourself and I just like your ingredients and stuff so I've decided I want to make like a lentil soup being as it is autumn now I thought it'd be quite nice to try and making my first into a soup so that's what I got there carrots and celery fall but I also got some hummus a snack they want to also make some like Mexican stuff so I got the tortillas because I'm thinking like sweet potato and black bean quesadillas and stuff like that and wrap so I'm gonna put some of these chicken things in the oven now just having a wrap put some salad for lunch because it's getting late and I still haven't filmed anything he is my chicken wrap right behind the scenes of filming I've changed my top put this one on and I'm gonna show you my setup I decided to film with my lights in my background sitting on my bed because as it's a story time I want this to be like nice and cozy like chatting to big sister vibes my camera is up here with my ring light next to it and I also have a window on top of my bed and I've blocked it out with a tshirt because otherwise one side of my face is really light a month the other side is really dark so that's just kind of evened out of it I am done I feel 2 story times I much preferred the second one so I think that's the one gonna be going up this Sunday when I sat down to think about what ones I wanted to talk about this one was at the back of my list but once I got the screen grabs of the text that he sent me after the day I was just like okay this is this is a great one I'll leave the link to that down below let me know what you think of it what time is it oh five o'clock I'm doing something I don't really want to do tonight and I'm meeting up with my ex we have a few things left to swap over and sign like documents that we need to sign we basically have a joint bank account together and I need him to sign it to close the account and he's got a couple of books of mine and a couple of letters have come for him so we're gonna meet at Westfield Stratford to do that tonight and I really don't want to go being a doorman oh you've done I'm so gonna back out of the way oh just post I've got a has to make that I soaked some of my black beans earlier they've been soaking for five hours so now I'm gonna make some sweet potato and black bean from scratch and like quesadillas I picked up some sour cream from M&S on the way home when my washing machine goes the whole room shake okay looks great but here on my back the quesadilla good morning it's quite early on Tuesday I didn't end the vlog last night because I was exhausted and I knew that I had to have an early one today today it's going to be very very busy so I've got four events on what was pretty much the most I've ever been to Monday so I'm a little bit worried about how I'm gonna do it all I'm going to use the well as Christmas like winter wonderland event that'll be nice then I'm going to an asus oven I think it's their asus Beauty I can't even talk it so early a sauce Beauty event and then I'm going to lushes creative showcase event and then I'm going to like a wellness event at the new Harley Medical Clinic I think in Liverpool Street for a facial so yeah it's gonna be a manic day also it's echos birthday today so when she wakes up later we'll have a little party which would be fun quickly show you what I'm wearing I'm wearing my new Topshop jeans I think the journey jeans with rips my new look train is so I'm wearing this top which is really pretty it's got like floaty sleeve and a sports bra my misery necklace here and then I've got this cardi from ASOS and this bag from boohoo which it fits like everything in for the day and I've got like two portable chargers my book need to get headphones yeah already let's go so I'm just at Sony winter wonderlands of enemies super cute just taking in the cheeky little Polaroid waiting pretty to develop there and yeah it's really cute I just got loads of snow in my hair because I went nah I'll put the boomerang me without a dog it's awesome and makes the happiness between us break down to have a little hearttoheart maybe shake it on now at the eighth of beads event there is a wall which is color coordinated with product three great I've seen maybe doing I'm so happy about it I'm absolutely exhausted I just didn't sleep last night and then lots of events today it was very it was a very long day but also everything went wrong today I got to my station this morning just after I vlog got cessation and realize I left my bank card at homes I had to go back home to get that then got back on the train and then I came over feeling very nauseous so I had to get off the train got off at Holborn and then once I felt a little bit better I tried to go back in the station to get back on the train and you can't enter Hoban station but before 10:00 a.m. it's to help control like rush hour I think it's exit only before 10:00 a.m. so then I got to try and get to the other side of London literally the easiest option was to get a cab so I got a cab all the way there which was an unnecessary expense but I had so many events to get to I was like I can't be late like I just can't I'm late enough as it is got there it was nice and then I was like right on to my next one got to the station and I was in my own world and I ended up walking trying I basically went to walk down an escalator but didn't realize it was an up escalator like the wrong escalator until I was on it and like flat on my face like imagine just walking onto the up escalator without knowing I like I was trying to go forward and my legs just went underneath me backwards it was very embarrassing anyway got in the Train met Megan which was lovely I basically spent the whole date with her today and it was great she's such a great blogger so fashionable and such a lovely girl so I'll leave her links down below you can check her out so we went to the a source of work together that was fun it was like interactive if we had to walk through a ball pit and through likes neon tunnels that was good and then we saw the new Beauty range which is coming out a source of launching some beauty products themselves then we went to lush event that was great and then my last appointment was my facial at the highly medical group clinic and I had to derma quest peel and my skin feels so good like after appeal it's quite Tingley out of feeling that i was going to leave that my face was gonna be bright threads but it's not and it actually looks really nice like I'm not wearing any makeup right now apart from one my eyes this is how my skin's looking I also got to talk to a dermatologist there and I asked her lays the questions about acne scarring after a row accutane she's recommended some products I'm gonna try those out she also recommended micro needling for like deep acne scars I've got some on my forehead like deep holes and also long hair as well so I'm gonna try that out I might see if I come back in somewhere to have some of that and I'll let you know how it's also guys I met so many lovely subscribers at the lush event I literally couldn't believe it you guys kept coming up it honestly made my day whenever someone came up was like oh hi watch your videos literally I felt like the luckiest girl in the world to be able to do this as a job and to meet so many of you lovely people you're all beautiful and so fashionable and so kind and lovely so thank you to everyone that said hello I would love to meet more of you at some point as well he's echos birthday today I don't know if I mentioned that already I've had my baby for a year and I haven't got her anything to celebrate I bought her a new toy but she's already eating it because that's what she does she just ruins orders by chewing and nibbling but I'll get her out tonight we can have a little bit of a cuddle I love her so much I have just made some dinner made vegetarian fajitas using my bat beans from last night also I forgot to mention I think I forgot to mention last night my bat beans are good next time I wouldn't presoak them I just cook them longer apparently they lose some of their flavor if you pre soak them I have sweet potato red pepper black bean cheese sour cream and my wraps I mean it's not again not the healthiest probably but delicious II the only issue is slightly irregular sizes in general the flavors it's actually the involvement of the coffee together of us this is wait I'm going to go to sleep now I had two lovely little cuddle with echo gave her some treats she's still running around my room those nights but yeah I hate everyone it's what day is it Wednesday I didn't want to look again today without makeup on but I wanted to show you I've been cooking because I am a cooking genius now apparently it's a spicy yellow lentil or carrot and celery soup here it is I think it's nearly ready it's been cooking for quite a while it's like the first proper soup I've made I think so I hope it tastes good I'm gonna blend this up and then I've just edited my weekly vlog took about four hours to do but it's finally exported now so now I can get ready I'm gonna have this lunch put my way corn and then get ready because I'm going on a date tonight a blind day my friends set me up with someone she knows and I've never done this before never done a blind date so I'm quite nervous and excited but at least we'll have stuff to talk about so we know nothing about me each other there it is bit of a fail it's way too salty I didn't realize that the stock cubes I used were really thought he anyway and I added more salt by accident and it's disgusting but I'm gonna read to anyway because I have slaved over this for hours now I'm definitely gonna have to have something else to eat before my date otherwise I am I'm gonna get so drunk because this is not enough food what a fail just done all my work for the day which is great I talked to my super way I talked all of it away but it was disgusting it was on edible so salty I've learned my lesson less stock powder no sort luckily the only ingredients I used was an onion some carrots and celery so and lentils obviously if it's not that bad I thought it would quickly show you some of the bits I got from my events yesterday first up lush oh no they don't have their names on I got loads of bath bombs but they don't have the names on so I can't tell you what is what unless I know them let's see so these the bits I picked up they're all Christmas and Halloween limited edition ones I'm pretty sure and I was so excited to get some of these earlier than they're released picked up one of my in fact this might be my alltime favorite luxury lush hood because it looks insane in the bath I've done a demo of this one this one and also this one so I'll leave a link to those lush demo videos below so you can see what they look like in the bath using an underwater camera this is monsters ball again one of my favorites shoot for the stars this is my favorite smell of all time it's the lush honey I washed the kids I love that so much then I think this one is thunderstorm I think I'm not sure but it smells quite minty but like sweet mint oh this is a Snow Fairy one it smells exactly like Snow Fairy this was the one I picked up at the till and I was like I cannot not have that because I've never used it before and then I also had a little skin care consultation whilst I was there and the woman said that I should try this it's the mask of Magnum I can't say this the mast of Magnum minty and it's a face and body mask and she tried it on me I realized when I got home I already have one of these so I could perhaps do a giveaway of this let me know what you think so these are the bits I got from a so Ella's launch they're mainly life so bit I got this little mug which I love I would have bought this anyway so I'm really happy about it it's a cozy vibes mug like emerald green inside with like gold polka dot detailing all available from boots as well at the moment her lifestyle stuff of it in time for Christmas then we've got this really cute bento station kind of stationary set I love the idea of a bento box so this has like a notepad washi tape but some really cute and paper clips pencils and a ruler and then this is her snow Ella body mist and it smells really great it's not your typical like winter festive fragrance it's a really kind of fresh version but I really like it I'd urge you to go and sniff this in superdrug if you can and then I was also lucky enough to get some bits from my facial sea fusion cleanser which they used on me for my facial and it smells amazing smart like oranges some derma clear pads and this which I've already been using because I love it it's the derma quest essential b hydrating serum after the lady had taken all my makeup off before my facial yesterday she showed me my face under UV rays so you can see like this the damage on your skin Oh insert picture here it's absolutely petrifying but you can see I'll have a lot of like redness and pigmentation on my and cheeks I asked if that was from acne scarring as she said no just like general redness but I think it is a little bit of Riley scarring and the bit that scared me the most was I had these really dark red circles around my eyes and I was like what the hell is that I always use eye cream I always put a lot of moisturizer on my face but she was like it's just dehydration because you're the skin around your eyes is so thin it's just really dehydrated so I was like what do I using so I thought I was using loads of really great products around my eyes turns out I need something a little bit stronger and more rich so this is what I've been using around my eyes now it's good I think it's got hyaluronic acid in it and hopefully they'll improve and not be so dry in the future but my skin is looking great today after that facial I think I can see the difference it looks she's more plump and glowy so I'll leave a link to that and treatment I had below as well I have to leave for my date in our half an hour I am meeting up with some of my circus friends first for a quick drink because they're in the area and I don't see them in ages and luckily enough it's right near the venue where my day has chosen for our date so I'm going to go beat them at whor 6 and then meet my date are Hopf so I'll show you what I'm wearing quickly before I leave got a dilemma in that I don't feel pretty today and I don't know what to wear I mean I used to have a date outfit I would wear to every single date but since I've been going on quite a lot obviously it's not great to wear the same thing and I'm trying to be a bit better with Claire this as well like proper get my juice out of all of them so I just have one of those days I didn't want to wear don't feel very pretty I just did like a fringe wash in the sink because I need to wash my hair but I'm gonna leave it at the day so far I've gorgeous a bag like vest and a black skinny jeans and I sit okay I think I'm gonna go for this I bought this top at a charity shop at the weekend for like four pounds I washed it yesterday because it had a really horrible dusty smell to it but now it's all ready and I think it's quite cute what do we think I think that would do I've just kept the browsing underneath right I think I'm ready to go there and I packed my bag I will see you tomorrow nah morning everyone I have a bit of a headache last night date went really well he was really lovely we ended up going for food we went to Andina in Shoreditch and we just ordered like loads of dishes and shared them oh that I need to go to that restaurant again the food is delicious it's a really nice date we had a couple laughs and he was like I'd say the first true gentleman that I've been on a date with in this period have been single anyway like he's just very gentlemanly and I haven't found that with the men that I'm meeting on tinder I really don't know what it is maybe tinder men just don't want to make an effort in a sense because probably gone so many dates they don't know if it's ever going to be worth it or will amounts for anything so they just are a bit lazy with like certain things but this guy was a Jen and I will probably see him again because we got them very well I've decided to work in the living room today because I've been working in bedroom quite a lot recently and I always find it really hard to sleep when I when I work up in the bedroom when I had an office down here I as soon as I went up to bed I was out like a log and that was really really special and very rare because I've always had a bit of an issue sleeping like falling to sleep just takes me hours and but now is the divide is getting a bit muddled again so I'm gonna try working down here today and hope that that helps me fall asleep quicker here's an exciting one today is I stand up for cancer this evening so I'm heading there about o'clock I think quite early I think it starts around 5:00 or 6:00 I will leave a link to it down below because it will be livestreamed but then hopefully published so you can catch up on it and I'm doing a quite like a few challenges I'm doing one challenge where I have like to apply my makeup in 3 minutes whilst bouncing on a trampoline petrifying I'm definitely gonna make a fool of myself but it's all in the name for charity so I'm fine with that I am getting a bit worried guys because I'm getting sports I'm petrified my acne is coming back I don't know if you can see but I have the biggest spot right here and it's very painful it's like right in the corner I know it's so so painful I had one here last week which came to a white hedge as well I'll keep you updated the rest of my skin looks fine it's just those two been getting slightly more concerned that my acne is coming back onto film racketing Q&A because I have so many people every single day asking me questions about my keychain like how old long I was on it what my dosage was how long it took for me to get even by dermatologists if they can bleach their hair on it I get so many of those questions every single day you wouldn't you wouldn't even believe how many I get so I thought would be good just to make one complete video answering everyone's questions so let me know if you would like to see that and I'll hopefully film it next week before I go on holiday I can't be bothered to cook lunch today so I'm just having a snacky hey miss carrot celery Anton of these I'm still obsessed with these are so good I just curled my hair using my new tongs oh I'll show you them they're the ght curved tongue classic curl and oh my God look I love it so much it's my first time using this and there's so much light it's so much lighter than the other tongues that I've been using which is the enraptured you know what I don't even think you can buy my M the tongues I've been using for years now anymore I looked them up the other day because I was like all they're getting old I might need to buy a new one but they're like on the brink and that's why I got the DHD one instead because I just couldn't find the in rapture ones anywhere but yeah I absolutely love how this has come out I feel so weird at the moment I don't know if you can tell but I feel like my mood in this vlog has just been really just not right lower than it normally is a bit less me and I've just been feeling a bit weird healthwise in the past week and I think it's affecting my daytoday I think I need to go to the doctor's there's two things that I really like intruding my life and the is my stomach I'm pretty sure I have IBF I obviously had the tests for IBD inflammatory bowel disease and that came back negative but I do think I have something wrong with my bowels TMI but I've just been getting very anxious recently about leaving the house because I have quite a bad stomach when I leave the house and whether I might I'm like oh God am I going to need the toilet this is TMI saurian I don't need to be telling you about my bowels but it might also be because I'm being really healthy at moment and eating loads of vegetables and my body maybe isn't used to that so it could just be that bus do I don't think I don't think it would be quite as urgent if that make sense the second thing is I am exhausted 24/7 I wake up from a get 8 hour sleep and I am exhausted I just had a nap I woke up quite late today I woke up at 10:00 just because I had a really late one last night and then I just had to have a nap at half one so that I was awake for three and a half hours and I was like I need to go back to bed I can't function and this has been happening quite a lot I just can't focus I can't concentrate I just need to shut my eyes my mum has this as well my mum and my sister actually were all just very tired people I don't really know what's wrong with me and that I think maybe it's a thyroid problem I don't know I need to do some research like I said in last week's vlog I think going for what run and getting out the house definitely helps but there's still absolute time I'm gonna prepare for another eBay video because you guys seem to like those so I'm thinking of doing like eBay shoes or bags for those who don't want to buy clothes from eBay but like online the eBay stores which sell clothes and bags for under ten pound maybe budget so I'm gonna do some research and see if there's anything good I'm someone also she suggested eBay home where or stuff like that and I thought that was a great idea but let me know if you'd like to see that because I don't know if it'd be it's just the clothes off that you like whether you wouldn't mind like cheap eBay home where fines the best my now say I have to do my nose and my lipstick was bouncing and champagne impaired I hope you have enjoyed today's vlog and a sneak peek behind the scenes warning it's Saturday today I have a day at home today before I go out with some friends in the evening we're going to go for dinner one of them is leaving she's moving to Australia for a year so we're going to go and have like a goodbye celebration I quickly wanted to show you something I'm very into my ear piercings at the moment as you may know very into jewelry in general for the first time ever and I bought myself some new earrings last night on a source like 11 o'clock so I bought them and they just arrived it's like 9 o'clock and they've just come so less than 12 hours amazing service so I got these ones I love safety pin earrings I wear them quite a lot anyway but these ones are from Aldo they're all around like the five to eight pound mark these just general a source ones I love like the little triangle and the square as well as quite cool they got some pain got rose gold studs I've just put the little one I was wearing in there as well then I got these ones as well I love the little moon it's someone to put some of these in now so I've also got this metal grid that I got from my birthday my mom got it for me and I want to use it as a jewelry stand but I'm not entirely sure how to make that happen I've got these like gold paper clips and I've just really kind of haphazardly tried to hang my necklaces of them although I'm not really sure this is the best way I feel like there's a much better way I just need to do some research so if any of you have any ideas of how I could kind of in I mean this grid to carry most of my jewelry then do let me know again no idea how I'm gonna do earrings how do you guys store your jewelry that's what I would like to know guys look at this it's a double rainbow one they're so bright I am all ready to go now I'm gonna show you I'm wearing I'm wearing these jeans which I've been wearing all week and my old favorite back blazer I had this in back and like a deep wine red and I sold the red one on deepok because I just didn't wear anymore but this is the first time I'm wearing it in ages is from River Island and I absolutely love it it's like the only smart blazer I have and then I'm wearing the vest top from Sheen which has a deep plunge like lace detailing but you can see my bra underneath also gonna take this cardi on top because it's getting quite chilly out now and it keeps raining today so I thought this would work as rain cover and snuggly to keep me warm later tonight yes I'm all ready to go I walk blog without a beach blanket Babylon I think the last time I went there was Valentine's Day 2014 so it's been a very long time I'm looking forward to it I looked at the menu again quickly and the food looks brilliant so very excited yeah I've just got home I decided that I'm gonna end this look here because next week's is gonna be a little bit different I'm gonna start next week this vlog from tomorrow Sunday and then do it until Saturday when I get on holiday and then I'm gonna save the holiday book for the week after I hope that makes sense I think I've had one too many cocktails and I'm waffling also you started to feel a little bit nauseous I'm not gonna be into much and that always makes me have a little bit of a panic attack that I'm gonna be sick I'm sure I'll be fine I've made myself a peppermint tea so I'm gonna have that and hopefully I will be okay but yeah yeah I will see you tomorrow for packing decluttering and then next week yeah bye now"	5899
"no_I WAS NAUGHTY ON HOLIDAY  Weekly Vlog #20.txt"	"no more waste they'll always be wrong hello everyone welcome to another weekly vlog I've just made it to Marrakech and I need to show you my room first thing because it's just incredible I feel like the luckiest girl in the world I've been quite jammy this morning and I managed to get an upgrade they must have like double booked the room or excuse my parents as well by the way look I always look so rough after traveling yeah they must have doublebooked to my room and so they've upgraded me to a superior suite and I need to show you it it's incredible so this hotel I'll leave a link to it down below is all white and then you come round here and he is my little like private balcony absolutely amazing and then we've got a nice view of the pool as well and then this is my room it's absolutely Hugh mungus this room is like bigger than my entire house look how big is still got my wardrobe I've got a nice little window to the outside area and this bed which i think is like a double king or something like that will say look at the ceiling how amazing is that it's incredible and then the bathroom it's very here my shoes asked me Kim take those off this is the bathroom again humongous they even got bday and a massive shower as well like I wish you could see how big this is in comparison to me I'm like I feel so tiny and not like I've got the biggest mansion of a house see ya this is my home for the next few days I was really naughty this morning at GT 3 at the airport so basically one of my best friend's got Mowbray but recently I said wedding present from her husband ignore my ex mok's so bad and I fell in love with this bag and I did loads of research on it I was like I need this bag in my life I thought about it for months and months and I was like I'm never gonna treat myself to it I don't own anything designer like literally I've never owned anything designer in my entire life so I was like I'm never gonna get it but I went past the mulberry store in Stansted and asked to see the bag and then I accidentally fell in love a little bit it's so crushed though I had to put my suitcase because I didn't want everyone to see that I'd treated myself to something but then also I found another bag and I fell in love with it so I might have got that myself as well but I don't want you to think that I'm changing or like getting turning into a luxury blogger I'm not at all like I am High Street through and through but I have been working really hard recently and I saved up a lot of money but I don't treat myself to anything really apart from food and a soft clothes so I'm just like I saved up loads of money like had some money left over from my wedding that obviously didn't go ahead and and I'm I've been saving up for a house and I was just like I've never bought anything luxurious I'm just gonna go for it so I bought something else as well as an early like gift to myself when I hit a hundred thousand subscribers so I'm not gonna open it until that happens if it never happens that was really sad and yeah I'll show you me that when I hit that obviously my xml my chest just looks horrific I'm hoping the Sun will kind of sort this out because it's not attractive right I'm starving I'm gonna get changed and then go out and grab some food and then maybe come back here and go for a swim and have a little bit of a sunbae that I want to basically read loads of books and spend some time in the Sun this holiday so that's what I'm gonna do I'm literally I'm like oh my god it's incredible I don't you want to open it because it's so like perfect I'm gonna open this up now before I put it in the safe um oh my god I'm gonna be too scared to take it out and use it I think so we did have a discount on it obviously because it was passed free oh my god isn't it beautiful very classic so this is the bag that my friend had and that I really wanted I don't even know what it's called I'm not into designer stuff at all it has a nice big compartment and a little zip there as well literally this is like a drawing you know it's not even a dream because I never dreamt that I would ever own a thing like this Wow Wow Wow and it's got a chain strap so both beautiful I buried thank you yeah Meridian struck me I don't know what this is but it's near a hotel and it's beautiful I just love all this rustic stuff this is the alleyway we've just left the craziness that is the souk to come to our hotel I am gonna go to bed now I'm exhausted I think it's like 8 o'clock in the evening focus like 8 o'clock but it's been such a long day we woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning cuz I flight was at 7 I tried to lay in the Sun after dinner but I was just falling asleep but I just wanted to say that Marrakesh is so beautiful it's a completely different way of life and once you come here I didn't you ever look at life the same way it's really hard to convey how beautiful and how much it's going on and how busy and all the how intense all the senses are while she'll here just through pictures or video so I'm trying my hardest to convey it but people II I'll get a better sense over the next few days of just how magical it is here bed time I can't even keep my eyes open have ordered a mint tea as room service which I'm very excited about more and mint tea is just the best I need to get some of the Gunpowder I think they use in it so I can make some of this stuff at home I wish you could smell this it's so good right just fresh sweet mint and you pour it from a height God said it bubbles some Moroccan omelette it is some day today all philosopher bearings already and we've been some bathing or morning met a subscriber can you believe it a girl staying at my hotel who's from Marrakesh came and said hello I really should have bought a foundation little bit darker than my normal skin tone cause this this is my outfit I'm hoping it's not too exposed the shorts are a bit short but I am covering the rest of my self up we're gonna go and have a cocktail and just a nibble to eat I think for lunch and then come back and chill here some more read my books good all good we've come to a cafe and these are juice days it's very pretty in here hello it's beautiful like we're in a rainforest it's very bright they say we've got seep we've got Moroccan sea french fries I've got salad got some dates on the side Lucy's Kate's gonna get to get in your date thanks mummy creig's look at this view some of the Sun is setting the pool is blue I can't get over this I am just off to dinner now with my parents with me eating at the hotel tonight just staying in I'm wearing this play suit from in the style I think I've got my accessorize bag and new look sandals first time wearing them out and they're a little bit uncomfortable also I think of burnt beneath but the rest of my legs look fine I love it here so much so you're beautiful I'm gonna start reading this as well cuz I'm early for dinner my vegetarian you could kiss Philip this vlog so far has been a little bit rubbish I hope it hasn't I was just told that I have to leave this room in the morning I think they're proper messed up on the weekends here you know what this place is beautiful but very unorganized and not great at service in general which is disappointing yeah I'm just packing up my stuff now so annoying I'm only here for two more nights after me it seems like wasting half of my holiday to pack up all my stuff again silly yeah I'm gonna go to bed now read my book in bed and I'll see you tomorrow hello it's quite early in the morning today I think it's Monday and my dad and I just had breakfast and now we are going to try by the supermarket there is no alcohol so we're gonna try and find some bottles of wine for the next few days just in case how beautiful like a knock on market version of the six we are in the main square now and we're trying to find some amber in soon we've actually walked past ten million William polian I'm Pedro I've had my first drink in days one day is so hot but it's amazing here olives although I smell so good come to Marrakech and got a burger hello it's been a really long day today my dad and I broke up early as you saw to go to the supermarket to get some booze and snacks got my favourite ever crisps they called months too much I've left them in my parents room and they're like ketchup flavored so but when I go on holiday I always get them they seem to have them everywhere but the UK anyway and then came back here it has a little chill in the Sun started reading my book properly then had a massage which was great it was a really great massage actually the pressure was great I just love a hand massage and a back massage my body aches so much after a circus so I kind of wish I had one every week but that's obviously a big strap again and then I came back and I came over with a headache I had a headache as I went into my massage room and it kind of turned into a migraine so my parents went for a couples massage after me I I took some migraine pills and shut my eyes for bricks that's the only thing you can do then I wash my hair because I got really oily hair after my massage and then we popped out we went to the Suk's and had lots of we went like three different bars for drinks and and had a really nice dinner on a roof terrace as well I had a burger I was just fancying carbs I haven't really eaten much today I had a really small breakfast and then a couple of crisps and then nothing so I was like shaking I was so hungry but needed all the carbs I'm back home now I've moved rims as well halfway through the day it's been such a long day so yeah this room is smaller but it feels a lot more cozy which I quite like I think I'm gonna have a really good sleep tonight the bathroom is a bit bigger as well and so I'm gonna go and wash my feet in the bday because wearing sandals and walking around in the Suk's makes me feeling a little bit dirty in fact I might just have a proper shower before bed get ready for bed properly and then I might watch a film in bed or read more of my book and then I'm gonna get some sleep and then tomorrow's my last fall day I feel like I haven't really had a proper chance to relax on this holiday yet because I'm not here for very long and each day I'm just counting down the days till have to leave so I feel like I haven't really been able to like let my hair down properly but it has been really nice to kind of soak up the Sun I feel like I've got a tan it doesn't look like it but this is quite this is quite good for me so I'm gonna just sunbathing more tomorrow and then a friend of a friend is currently working in my fish at the moment she's doing aerial and a place called Buddha bar so I take my parents there tomorrow night so we can see some of her doing some aerial silks I think it's gonna be quite late one and my flight is really early as well but it should be nice to do something a little bit different so if this book has been rubbish so far it's hard to look when you're on a holiday because it's either just like laying around or exploring and then also America she's so busy it's like I don't want to thrust at the camera in people's faces like the locals faces when they're just getting on their day to day life I don't want to be intrusive but it's been really good thank you I've got my first wet my very first expresso martini and it's delicious and a cream or vegetable soup with this view there you go one each now you go I love you very much you know temerity is stuck on the heavy guy commotion appears my it's just about time trust in the system to fire it's a memory the Hammond truck hisses Dubai anyway palliative of your car is the my supper visual law you never ever get my lord do anyway I am hime today has been so long but I'm so happy to be home I'm not gonna lie I was in a proper panic yesterday because I was really worrying about my flight by myself and the person next to me being sick I didn't mention this but on the Dom that airplane there to the holiday so many people were sick I didn't see any but and I heard people talking about it something threw up on themselves before the plane even took off I don't my brain doesn't even understand how that is possible and then I fell asleep on the flight and wake up as an air hostess was passing a sick bag over my head to someone else in front of me so it was just a bit of a fail a man fainted on the airplane as well it wasn't even like it wasn't turbulent or anything but everyone seemed to be ill and fainting so after that I was like the person next to me on this flight home is going to be sick and I'm gonna be by myself so I had like the sense of doom for the past two days just worrying about that but it was fine when I got on the plane I just said to the air hostesses that and I had a bit of a I've got a phobia and that I might have a panic attack basically so I'm so stupid and dramatic but I got my mind just doesn't work in the right way in when it comes to that and then the man that was sitting next to me on the flight I asked him if he gets motion sickness and he didn't talk a word of English I was just like this is great it's literally I had I put a jumper over my head so I couldn't see anything I had music up full blast and I literally just shut my eyes the whole way there yeah I was really worried but it was fine thankfully absolutely fine but now I'm home I've been home for just under an hour already working back at work editing my weekly vlog I think it's gonna go up late because there's over an hour of footage and Ivania 13 minutes so far but I haven't eaten yet really today either so I grabbed a cross on pie no chocolate thing at the airport in Marrakech and I didn't really sit on the plane because I didn't want it to make other people fall sick stupid so neat it now looks like this just made my first cup of tea as well it was all so lovely to come home to a clean bedroom floor hello everyone it's Thursday today my first full day back at home I'm quite angry it's 2 o'clock and I haven't filmed yet I want to film another EBA video today to go live on Sunday but I'm just trying to get tickets for this theatre performance with punchdrunk the CT kits keep like messing up the website so I've been trying for hours now to get tickets and it's not happening I really need to film I'm just about to have some lunch I ordered like a wagamama takeaway last night not wagamama do something completely different something just local and I got myself some sushi for lunch today so that's what I'm about to have hopefully get some tickets in a minute and then I can get to filming I've also been doing loads of Bill stuff like working out my bills and trying to get my life back in order and his routine stressing me out oh I hate I hate numbers I just filmed a video it took me a long time excited to

and I'm going to work with my friend tomorrow again we're gonna just sit in a like a cafe or a pub all day and work so I can edit Sunday's video then and then hopefully it'll inspire me to get more back on track working with someone else as well I'm taking my new baby out for the first time tonight and I'm a little bit nervous about it I love it so much that I don't want to take it out in case I

absolutely stunning location so I can't wait to go and eat there about Maine we've got duck eggs and some salmon cameras click on something there we go we've got coconut oil spinach and a little lemon to squeeze over the top I'm going to get on with cooking now because not actually the best of cooks so me trying to cook while took known as is disaster I probably said the house on fire probably head to the shops and try and pick up a few bits because I've got some shoots this week and then I'm going to the dentist for 12 o'clock I only managed to get like 25 minutes and shop again because now richness Filipinos as well managed to pick some bits up top man which I'll show you later when I get back home yeah I didn't get a chance to try with 9000 picking bits ups and throwing it in a bag rarely but yeah I didn't manage to get the trainer's because somebody see any trainers I actually liked than a while I sometimes obviously different seasons stuff it's different yeah that wasn't actually anything I really like that much but yeah sorry I'm at breath just literally rushing to the I got some nice jackets and a nice shirt I really really like and it up spending about 400 pounds on a few things from top cement and a wide these are the two lovely people that put up with me every two weeks and yeah what they do is they shove things in my mouth so I can't talk and I'm like and they just tell me and call me whatever they want but yeah I'm gonna sit down now and get on with it because their brother works and I'm taking up all the time okay so had my new invisaligns fitted so if I sound like a plonker that is the reason why I'm just walking to the restaurant now I've just got off the tube and found out it's a ten minute walk so we're done turned horrendous you're like Doris American tsunami or wherever is called thunderstorm remember what it was Doris the storms back but AB yeah another thing anyone else excited as I am to watch the new Power Rangers movie it's literally as a kid I was brought up with this movie watching it every single week TV series and stuff movies coming out a car literally way to watch it but I kind of like we're all watching it so I feel like to watch the movie but let me know in the comments box below if that's me being sad or if you'd watch it as well anyway I'm starving and it's raining my hands are so I'm gonna put the camera away those cameras arrived we've got the two lovely couple here with me Indians Brent no you should've find my guys hola their argument again I'm gonna go put the knife just close by the way guys is absolutely insane very pluggable his the bar I mean I currently look a little bit like a handful of girls and because of these bloody lights in the gym I made it here on time Jules as I said earlier cancelled this morning to these frames and then I've been rushing around the day supporting it down the road so the like shit but I made it here on time here we go smoke again and yeah I'm training Ches today I'm not going to show you what to do it today because I already showed you that yesterday's video yeah I check him when I'm done just got back from the gym and I feel like today has been a very hectic day it's been rushing around from one place to the next obviously my personal trainer changing the time this morning kind of through all my times off guard so when I went for lunch I had to literally dash to the gym so I didn't really do much filming them because I was nearly late for my PT session so I've got back I've just literally just put my comfy clothes on whacked a face mask on which I use it's this is what I use I use two of like two different products there's a white one and then there's also this one by glam glow so you just put it on with a brush and then you peel it off after and it's really really good this is a great great brand face mask so um yeah if you like face masks like me and definitely check them out but yeah I just wanted to run through quickly before I kind of close off this video what i bought in shopping earlier now i didn't really get much chance to do a lot of shopping because as i said i got into town late and i had to rush off to my dentist appointment so I only managed to get into top man but I did still manage to buy quite a lot while I was in there so I got this jacket first of all which is from lost youth which is a brand that sold like inside of top man it's like a jacket and it's got some really cool patterns on it and it's like a suede as well so yeah it was really really nice and this is pounds for that man like I've got an obsession at the moment with kind of like like jock you can call him job jackets like kind of baseball jackets so I bought a red one recently from Levi's but I bought this one today from Topman which is grey his Lexington on it and you've got like the cream arms as well so yeah I'm in love with this this was fifty quid to perform top man as well and then like I've got a really big thing about shirts going over tshirts at the moment don't know if it kind of because Springs come in and it's quite a comfy thing to wear and it's not too warm but probably will get a little bit cold if you don't wear a jacket but actually prefer to be colder than to warm and but I bought another kind of shirt you probably see me recently wearing quite a lot of shirts over tshirts and I quite like stripes so yeah I bought this over shirt striped shirt I just said shirt again but then you've got buttons down the middle oh that's nice that was 35 pounds then I bought which I really really liked but they didn't really have my size so I'm going to try and make this work but I bought this kind of twopiece so you've got these they're like smart trousers but they're like jogger trousers so I bought these with this kind of like texture and then I bought the jacket or the top as well so it's like a twopiece again with that texture so I bought them and then I felt this I tried it on with this tshirt and it went really really well with this kind of like tucked in to the trousers so altogether I think tee shirt was which is really good because I really actually like the tshirt and then a the top was 65 and then the bottoms were so 60 70 80 90 under like a 118 pounds like that so yeah they didn't have it in my size the only 30 regular and I'm normally like a 28 especially when they're like chokers as well you can't put a belt around but I'm going to try and make it work anyway but yeah that's what I bought from shopping I'm going to close up this video now thanks all for watching I hope you enjoying these vlogs if you are don't forget to give me a thumbs up if you're not already subscribed don't forget to subscribe and we'll be putting like a little button right there so you can click on

your local area like you have this independent tiny bookshop where the children can get stickers well yeah you will be doing something at home domestic talking about how you're sorry that they don't get to watch your glamorous life but next week will be much more grammar but it never is I'm going to say it has a certain wildlife needs it's gently set on the counter always always where's my closest cupcake so next week is going to be even less glamorous and asleep I don't know how to say chin back next week for less than even this on your camera my introduction to Murray's content Marie and I both have blogs it's that okay okay okay this guy's like a subscriber yeah he let me do my special excited voice multiple claws okay so here's Marie here she is she's got a weakness on she's wearing a bra from Costco here she is pretty sure she is a brilliant woman living alive yeah that just adds it this camera is where I dropped it when we was Bainbridge Island it got shattered language what a bit cool Bainbridge like okay turning up by though what did I call it forgotten dirty p.m. up with dirty words and we weren't funny the police thought they were funny it was a much too often cool funny Bainbridge Bainbridge bridge bridge bridge bridge Bay Bridge and it wasn't funny you thought was and you said it in a good 15 times me not funny I know it's not it is how it was no great sorry for tomorrow between that and hunting customized those are the highlights oh yeah how the great summer wasn't it it was great maintenance essentially no she owes big memories and gabelli mean about to show you something I'm deeply ashamed of going to church me things have gotten a little bit out of hand in the dressing room but I just throw all my clean laundry on the floor that's who we are the boxes of stuttering I haven't dealt with this suitcase is from when I went to New York who months ago so I was very kindly gifted this really cute outfit look at the M sleeves on this from next Maternity I've added the belt myself because without the belt actually it's very loose and I think this would be great when you've got a really big bump but I've only got like something little going on so this is perfect I'm going to wear some sandals with it way up to know cuz you'll wear heels actually should see what looks and feels or that's very nice all high and wearing here look at me other sevenfoottall when I wear here oh yeah wearing heels she's going to sort of life out and it's going to be okay we've made a degree of progress this certainly sorting out this facilities this looks so much more than it is no the opposite this looks like it's not a lot but that is like a whole wardrobe of clothes there and but I have removed the case the move like the Tower of them boxes sorted out up there it's a tiny bit so day by day I'm going to sort through this and just make it a bit more manageable make there look semi presentable and the only index really doesn't think that what I've done is embed map to full morning which obviously is the truth that I know have a good relationship forms on lies and deceit how we get through life just thinking everything's going to be okay until that day you know everything's a bag of shit good nice and cheery two beds made getting together some snacks as have got a three hour car journey to Crystal's now and then do the thing until three hours back can't say I'm looking forward to that element of it and so it's not to point to the points the people that are there like she loves doing these things I wanted to get to calculus I do love doing these things and I don't love all the trouble especially when it's already sick and nauseous so how can some snacks Catala help I'm going to have a little tinkle that's all really and then we'll be on our way I'm going to take some grapes that's very close up stop frightened I'm in Bristol and major after three hours in the car a little bit of a stick up here's Emily that's nice then we go to the Q&A and I'm listening to film some bits that she can you maybe you already read it or leave the books that you've got what to do good okay so that makes sense for you okay no one else I'll make like it'll make sense after you have like when you watch a film and then and there are all really relatable characters you're going to enjoy reading it how long does it take you to put this beautifully together then I already have all the idea in the plot all mapped out but then sitting down and like right or once upon a site mean there's no liner notes or time but like I'm really starting to fully shutting my laptop and being like done everything sense because have month which in book term is really quick at work when you're in it feels like an eternity there's Lila who little that every generation have a story and I thought I shouldn't have another story though has been help like if no one but pressure is really important thank God lately yeah I think you can stand out and yeah I'm going to repeat your question refuses so a shortened version of maximum question is how do you find juggling it with the rest of your life without balance and there's not a lot of things that I'm actually that good at in my life but time management I earn through that if you are one of those people that is like oh I am so sick of over privileged youtubers complaining about that over privileged lives then give ahead my friend because I am an over privileged person about to complain about my over privileged life was really big but basically I just feel shit today I feel shit yesterday I felt so sick I didn't film so many officer I got Emily just to film little bit of the Q&A dear but we sat in a park for like half an hour before the signing of media students and heavy breathing but traveling being in cars and trains to jiggling around the motion of it really sets off my sickness and fifteen or sixteen I need to check my hat fifteen or sixteen weeks now and for the most part at home I'm absolutely fine but it's a minute are getting cars and cars and trains maybe playing kind of it on a plane for a while but just me feel so sick yesterday it was seven and a half hours in the car in total today it's going to be the same and feel really ready about it like I don't want to go which is such a shame because I like the events are likely at reviewing it and I like signing a lot the talking to people bit I just take the traveling so so so much so feeling really apprehensive about that and it's getting me down and like making me feel really rubbish I put on some 80's music and have a long shower and like did my face to like cheer myself up a bit I'm wearing casual clothes some gosh that's like half fat half bump and to make me feel comfortable and then also if you've been watching in previous vlogs you'll have seen that I've been visiting my grandma a lot in her and her like LV housing Felicity it's not a nursing that she'd she'd be like don't tell people it's nothing that's not it she gets their own apartment in complex for all people with apartments and there's like healthcare on hand to and Darcy calls it her old people hotel anyway my grandma's taking a real turn doesn't remember what she was taken of her and she's in hospital she's not doing very well she's 93 my dad is really optimistic and my dad won't watch this video is fine um but he's like yes I just can't fix certain I just like feel so Saxon like I had like she's very old and I think that's like not taking on board the severity of situation perhaps but why would you want to fix your own parents and I feel really sad for her and I feel sad for my granddad blockages I mean this is an unusual problem lots of people have grandparents that aren't doing very well because that's the nature of getting old but you know something that's going on in my life and so there's no point harping on I'm going to go and get some go to the shops and get some fresh fruit and some dry salty crackers because those things that you feel nice at the moment and just suck it up and hope for the best and go to a signing and try not to be sick on people there okay three minutes in if you skip to exit one hear me Moaning you are you're safe now it's safe to go Jenna what I'll film later because they're all the same don't know what fell at these things alrighty maybe see you later on maybe see tomorrow what is in the background I'm checking because I've got all the baby things in this room I'm in the guest room and I've got some be be cleared soon year that are Rundle specific going on the oceans lipstick notes as a spot that's just my skin certainly and lots of you are guessing either as a hall if you want to watch a genderneutral baby hall and lots of you are saying boy which is which is a fact that you are saying that okay so do right by one this is lundi calc this is her son's account Hey and music and in other word an amazing booth Oh Miriam I mean is empirical I have forever this is a proof so this is not quite what the cop is going to like when you'll write and shop I would imagine this is available to preorder which you should definitely do we need a drink and definitely you should do that immediately you probably already have because she's released like shit turn loads a handful of I heart but it's like I heart Paris or not Christmas I heart New York variety of them and I love them all I love Angela flock I love the story I love the writing style and really excited screams something to read in the car no it's going to be like sweet sweet nectar mmmhmm yeah I've arrived and as you can see from my face it's not going well I'm not feeling too good so if you're someone that's at the Manchester signings sorry this is the face that you're getting tonight midnight at home and didn't really go very well I mean the actual talk did in the signing gauge but I can't do that much time in the car just mainly so sick and then I was like doing that silent cry be like I'm fine and fire was like I'm not fine and she thinks it cars just don't agree with me at the moment so I gave it my all during the actual talk obsess if you were at the event then I have half the cash to scratch me okay please please righteousness today we're really scratch me yeah I'm going to blast ow and call it a day and hope so I feel a bit better in the morning but yeah good morning it's Friday I'm in much better spirits today I'm feeling not I'm not saying like I feel so great I still feel a bit ropey but I don't feel like atrocious like I did yes they like crying and juicing atrocious so I think that's positive and another positivity I'm slowly slowly tackling my wardrobe so we still have the yet folding pile of doom to handle but this box was full of stuff and I entered the staff planning's now fill this all for charity and that's little washing pile there's some Darcy bits there this is stuff that even charity wouldn't want like a really really old bra a prison and a nicer broaden but this for example this old patty bag was my 21st birthday present and I bought it with my friend Steph Steph if you're watching hello from accessorize literally 10 years ago and I've been saving it because it's sentimental but I'm never ever going to use this bag ever sounds like it's time to go and I don't think the cameras picking it up but it is filthy and I can't put it in the wash that's delicate so just sort time to use to see the end I'm going to tackle this book now and what I'm going to do so currently just move baby clothes I haul my skirts here and then junks down here so I can't hang anything again junk down here so I can't hang anything stuff folded here which shouldn't be there those are organized but I want to get rid of them it well I've already gone through and taken quite a lot out here these don't look Logan eyes but I know what's what dress section Disney's tackling but feel like dresses are so sentimental to me cuz they buy them for specific things and then fall in love with them like it goes really far back but what I might do is put some in the loft which is hoarding isn't it all cycle much issues a day and then up here are the bags I'm keeping these are like my good bags on my special bags and a lot more of the bags have gone in there for charity something this house doesn't have a lot of or any of its nooks and crannies see sentimental like this my dad brought me this one and this little trophy that I got a little selenium that lives in there and like there's nowhere to put your bits and boPET so I've got a whole tray of them here we go a tray of sentimental shit I definitely don't need that can't throw away this is when Mum and I think that thing we excessive what we not throw like in keeping these heart my dad and I collect glass hearts for each other and go away and this is my mum's that she found in the beach this was given to me by I don't aren't on my granny and it's like a cat and it's lost its nose on ears but I just love it to merge and then I got like this that Darcy made for me at school and this for when I went to the United Nations like this windowsill can't say like this because eventually eventually eventually all of this space here is going to be the babies space because this room you probably know this room attaches onto my bedroom and I want the baby and I think I'll be turning around so to begin so to begin with baby will sleep like literally right next to me but then and this sounds like such a wacky thing to say is let me do the house is a big house and my room is on one side and the other rooms are far away oh god if I'm like such a Bellin don't I what I'm saying is for the first couple of years probably I want the baby to be super close to me so let me just move back this is a really really this is a really really massive room like I don't know if the cameras picking up just how enormous it but like this room is bigger so my old bedroom so there's definitely enough space to have like our little water it set up but also turn this area into it's like bedroom area and then eventually and it will have its own bedroom obviously that's own toys with their space and yadda yadda it's not gonna sleep in mommy and daddy's wardrobe forever but this is the idea I'm sure there'll be some people that I like that's really weird your baby sleeping in your wardrobe but hopefully some who you will get it anyway I think you are oh boy okay the lounge is slightly more tinier than a bit of sorting out and my bag is packed mainly full of monstermunch helium these are mine and we're off now for the nottingham signing for what like minutes the first one means contractually so that would be nice to have that company i don't know how i don't know if it really is going to see me in that way because he just sees me unlike fun home way and like mum mummy way but not like I'm at a book siding that I wrote way we don't think that make sense to anybody except me all right oh he's already gone outside to the car really good I'll get my shoes on and see you later so um I didn't film any fat but it went well Charlotte do you think it went well very well it went really well as far as the books in the office I mean like the sort of his office and beings going to get a little cheeky might almost be in the car or at home and that's it that's the end of the week to talk and I will see you next week I think I might do a live show next week as well there's also two new videos of my main channel to pursue normally one I'm going to start seeing about doing two and so yeah a lot for you to go and have a look at thank you so much for watching I think this videos gonna quite long it always is and all yeah it's fine"	5530

are they closed I've been going through some gifts that I received at my book signing oh my gosh that just took me so long I should have done a time lapse completely you didn't think about filming it I've had so many boxes of presents from you guys from my pointless book 3 tour it's insane it's insane so I'm thank you so much number one and I thought I'd show's over a couple of them this one is so cute well on you guys as well this one is so cute look at that I know it's just per se people have been asking my comments recently actually two things number one is where is Percy people burn us in Pippin sorry and number two is how is Percy so number one to answer Pippin sadly passed away about yeah maybe about three months ago so that was sad but Percy is absolutely fine and I've put him a lot in the blog yesterday of stuff we still chat with him a lot knowledge still hangs out with him Percy's all get and pippin solid sadly passed away but this was a cute little thing there's me with a little camera Zoe nya and Percy remember when we were driving back from somewhere and we've probably and Sean and we stopped off and I got that salad and it was like the big station where you can believe and get food and everything there's a Starbucks there but Donald everything yeah and we met that family what a young couple with the little girls so the mum they must have come to my book signing I didn't I didn't know it was them otherwise I would have said like hello properly well maybe I did and I've just forgotten anyways we met this really really cool family and were chatting to them for literally like minutes or so and the mums name oh my gosh let me get this right because the mom and dad's names sound similar Sharon and the dad's name is Darren that's amazing they gave me a present I think is cool and I think from the business card that's joint over there it's the mom's company so this is your one oh and this is my one oh my god painting look at that cheers Cheers and they've got like a little nyla I logos on let's ugh life YouTube my camera went yeah yeah there's a letter in your one I've already put that away my letter into my box fun fact for you guys Missy I said that there's a business card in your one that says handpainted glasses personalized glasses for any occasion Karen Cummings and her you her email is Karen with the K dot Cummings at sky.com if you want to get personalized glass oh did I say shower yes I mean Karen and Darrin is the dad's name Darrin and then their kids names alike I don't think she's mentioned there what are the girls names something like Freya I want to say Emma but it's not Emma as ms or some dad I said their names in my vlog yeah because I just read the letter and paints there yes so there's me the YouTube logo PB logo and a little Nala how cool is that got Zoey here zoella logo youtube so glowed Oh Nala she's Casey's handpainted glasses that's one of your guys mum's everywhere there was tons tons more presents that were very very thank you no but obviously our quite show every single one in the video yeah I've already showed them oh yeah yeah we're about to take Nala route for a little walk in the countryside what but it's raining quite a lot like it's not very cold but it's very wet so I'm trying to think of the best jacket the best the best shoes that I don't mind getting I don't mind getting incredibly wet and muddy this coat I got given free in a photo shoot once and I loved it oh maybe these probably shouldn't be wearing these jeans literally I'm just gonna get soaked have you outgrow now okay go your little coat on we can't find the extendable lead we're currently collecting Conchas putting them in a little dog poo bag to take back and clean up let's corn there just make sure that they're not all that chipped and stuff the shows what we need to do is we need to put some of these conquers or there's a big one yeah we need to put some of these clunkers in the corners of our our rooms then we don't get spiders living living slightly further out into the countryside we get so many spiders and like big spiders as well guys it's not just tiny little ones none of what we're looking for that's the one that you open the other side in your bag there he is we've done a tradeoff and I dunno who's won so he's currently having to wash Nala in the pantry even though this in here is a dog wash so we were getting the house all done up in here we got a dog wash put in but the light kind of doesn't work and also I filled it with like games and stuff so we're not using that just yet we will plan to start using that soon in the meantime as I was currently washing Nala in the pantry sink and the tradeoff per meter to not have to wash Nala in the sink and give her a bath was to walk around the garden picking up with the dog pee that we've missed and people say that being a youtuber is glamorous currently vlogging picking up my dog shit I don't think I've shown you guys before but on the front of our house here we have a little birds nest I'm not even sure if I've told Zoey actually I don't if you're going to have to see and sometimes when I'm getting in and out the car and stuff I'll see tiny little birds I'm not sure what kind of birds they are fly in and sit down and just like chill in there and you can't occasionally see them sitting in there most of the time you can just see them flying in and out all right or the dog poos picked up how's the bath going you enjoying it having fun in all of the concerts reflected into a little Pam ready to clean there's some very up liquid it's quite a few hours later I don't know if I'm allowed to say this so I feel that there's a weird law to do with advertising on YouTube if you work with a brand or you promote a product you're not allowed to talk about that product again without saying yeah I'm just gonna say his name I don't have to say what book says oh he's cooking dinner tonight and she said I'm making a sausage e beanie thing and I was like okay I was assuming baked beans definitely not baked beans she's cooking from a book by my friend Jamie Oliver I feel like I'm not allowed to saying the name of it now otherwise I have to add in this video in this video is not an ad we just legit cook in or Zoe's cook in look at that looks amazing this is what it's going to look like prep ten minutes cook 45 minutes so it's going to be ready in 45 I am so hungry my stomach is like cramping so now I've come out and seen all of that oh my gosh can I not have a little snack okay good I'm so hungry I'm like beyond angry 45 minutes sharp a banana feel like that's a good that's not gonna fill me up that's not gonna fill me up oh okay okay how's it look in oh my gosh smells delicious hmmm I don't know what it is should we get some plates mmm bottle of water and my dinner that's about to go and get an ice cream for dessert and then I remembered that one of you guys at one of my book signings gave me wasn't my books were they that was ages ago maybe it was sent to uh so easy a box or something from somewhere I've received a box full of like chocolate and sweets from another country and I don't know what country it's from so you can probably tell me in the comments and then on each one they've got like a little sticker describing what the item is like which is lovely let me ever put the effort in thank you so much I'm guessing or it could be German this one says in German you would say death is its standart you just have to taste this I can't guessing these are all German then literally dikmen's and the shape of the little things look like condoms it's called dikmen's and they're like condoms which is a bit weird because they're like kid sweets well these look cool look at that and then a call ya know is that the softest marshmallow ever we have got one of the best German chocolates with strawberries I'm finding it difficult to open the chocolate bars and stuff whilst I walk at the same time did you show yeah this is not a trying candy video this is simply me one in a snack that's me one in a snack off to dinner and these on the side in the kitchen what strawberry oh my god it tastes just like something means very used to eat Wow I know we've been the same what was that it was like this four out of five for you inside 10 oz this is the one that said you just have to try it this looks amazing this looks like Nutella in a little sandwich it was one ate Charlie one yeah the other ones in the kitchen look at that they come in like a little tray here's your one wish we share one let's share one mmm that's my favorite one so far aisle five yeah mmhmm that was the end of my not so a trying candy video even though I tried candy in the video back to the normal daily vlog in other words means Zoey watching Oh Barney will now watch an X Factor it's half past ten and I'm currently watching Dragons Den on the sofa this has always been one of my favorite programs seeing new businesses potentially get an investment by professionals with tons of experience and I just love seeing all of the different ideas all of the different businesses the people have come up with in companies I used to sit with my dad when I was younger and watch his program all the time that's the goal in life for me to be in the position where I can invest and help out tons of small companies the have potential to be the next big thing and jump on board and help the ideas come to life I've already one day are like properly chat in videos I feel like it would be cool to sit down soon and probably chat to you guys about all the different percentages of companies that I own and things like the crate like you guys know publicly that I own 50% with the greatest store that's growing at the moment we're hiring three new people for the craters at the moment my team over in the office I'm hiring I've new people at the moment and there's also other companies that own shares in his word that you guys probably don't know that I do you guys you wouldn't even know that I do that kind of thing someday soon when I feel like it's right I'll sit down and do like a long chatty video and talk to you guys all about that kind of thing but for now and now I'm just watching Dragons Den on the TV sleepy or should we take that to the toilet first"	2389

chill um you know see my family do all that and then I'm in an internship now because that's required for my school um so yeah so it was just kind of like one thing after another and I was still trying to you know do blogging things and take photos and um do stuff like that so it's been a little crazy and yesterday I had my internship from 8: in the morning like 7:30 which was a really really long day for me so in May I finished my sophomore year of college so I had finals and everything like that going on you know which was a little bit of a struggle and then once finals ended I had like a week to chill um you know seeing my family do all that and then I'm in an internship now because that's required for my school um so yeah so it was just kind of like one thing after another and I was still trying to you know do blogging things and take photos and um do stuff like that so it's been a little crazy and yesterday I had my internship from 8:00 in the morning to like 7:30 um which was a really really long day for me um you know I'm just not used to that like god bless if if that's you know in everything day for you guys I give you so much props or like you know working retail

in a really long time so I have today off which was really nice of them um and yeah so I was like okay perfect day to vlog and actually catch up and then tomorrow Saturday too so I figured it would be perfect um okay I'm going to what am I gonna do oh I'm gonna take some photos of course okay guys I'm gonna give you a room tour now um let's start with my desk lamp thing here from Ikea and then my desk usually I don't have my laptop on my desk it's like tucked away under my bed for the most part but for reallife purposes um there it is okay so we have my perfume tray over here um with some baby's breath because it's just my favorite and I feel like it's just the perfect makeup table flower if that makes sense um and then of course this mirror what you guys have probably seen enough of is from Etsy and then I have jewelry over here my makeup brushes and some pens pencil scissors you know all that and then in these drawers are my makeup which yeah and then this little chair I got because my author chair literally broke I was sitting on it one day and it was that total movie moment where I just fell on my ass because of my chair um so I got this from a really random website I'll try to link it down below because I can't remember the name of it right now but yeah so that's there I need to hang this picture up um you know laziness has gotten the best of me and then over here I just have a huge basket of magazines um my collection is growing more and more every day I just got this quarter or port a magazine I need to read and then I have some pot in over here randomly um and then big thing I have my bike which is not in the most ideal place honestly I still need to finish building it it's just so hard like I need to finish this and then for the most part it's done but that's why that's just kind of stuck in here because I literally have like no other room and then you guys have seen this shelf before it just has some books and you know other vintage stuff yeah nothing too crazy over there and then my bed which is pushed up against the wall um and then you know right by the window I have some cute little succulents over there they're very happy because they get to absorb all that sunshine and then next and table pretty simple right now I just have that picture which I got I think it's by the artist or Reeb oh are ìbe um I'll tag it below again and then tons of candles and little Dipity perfume and just random stuff um kind of an appropriate photo of um cactus in this cute little basket I wish I could take it out of that plastic thing but I'm pretty sure the dirt would just get everywhere in here oh so it's just it's like that for now but if you squint your eyes a little bit it looks like it's in the basket and then of course we have my rack um yeah blow some of my favorite shoes and stuff um some Chanel books this carpet is terrible I really don't even want to show you guys cuz look at how dirty it is ah I definitely want to get a new one um just because this white / cream color is really not working and then over here just a little inspiration corner I have um some notes and stuff from brands and you know just some memories some Polaroids yeah and these two little bags hanging on my door my mirror and that's it um so yeah I mean it's basically where I want it to be kind of I am getting some furniture pieces I still want to hang that up and I still just want more like wall art um so hopefully that will happen and I definitely want to do like an official official room tour but I just want to wait until everything is you know the way I want it to be also guys I just posted music to get you through a chill day on NYC BAM be calm and I literally put the playlist in the post which I'm very it's so easy but I'm like so proud of myself oh yeah it's just something a little bit different so if you want to check that out go to NYC BAM be calm hi guys so it's a bit later now it's 6:00 I think oh my god I look so rough okay I obviously need to touch up my makeup a little bit but um the big you know thing I had to do today is done so I am going to just chill for a little bit because I'm still like tired literally from yesterday um but then around 8 o'clock Adam and I are gonna go out and have a nice little dinner so I'll probably film a little bit of that for you guys um and yeah I hope your day is going well I wish I had more to like report back on but because I'm thinking about changing up my cleanser because like even though I recently purchased it it's the fresh soy cleanser and I've heard so many good things about it but I don't think it's working for me like I feel like I need something that's foamy and something that looks like it's working like because the soy cleanser is more of a gel I just feel like it's doing nothing and I feel like it's not really getting into my pores so I'm thinking about switching it up and maybe like buying an exfoliator or something um but I'm sure you guys will will see that because I want to do a little updated skincare post on my blog for sure because I haven't done that in forever um also just in case you guys were wondering um I'm wearing this necklace from OH I don't even know how to pronounce it well like weeow jewelry and this top from Zara um jeans from H&M I might change for going out to dinner I'm not sure I need to check how warm it's going to be because it was a beautiful day outside today it was like 77 degrees so sunny I think tomorrow is going to be warm too but I don't think it's going to be as sunny um but I'll keep you updated on what I'm gonna wear tonight this isn't really an update because I'm still wearing the same shirt but um yeah so I just changed my jeans out for old these um dark redone just because I felt like they were more appropriate for like nighttime um and then I know my boots when it's June but it's supposed to get a little cold so I don't know these are from Calvin Klein and then my Chloe bag um so yeah so I'm actually taking the subway down to Bleecker Street and then I'm gonna meet Adam um at the restaurant okay real quick fragrance that I'm going with tonight is jazz club by replica or um you know Maison Margiela fragrances it's so good it's like woody oh and um kind of masculine but I don't know I just really really like it okay I'm actually going to leave now and this video is so how to focus

shingles I got once and go ending the book so tonight no give me one in a book less to no talk about shingles although I do love to talk about that shingles at time I think the dress makes a karma to come to the mirror I'll show you what I mean let's take a moment to be real here on a bigger woman anyway and I don't know if this dress is showing the pregnancy or just like I've got a Wibbly tell me anyway but this is more with more sticking out than normal but look there's this which I don't know like am i pregnant in my ass as well well the wrong I'm tiny bit struggling with this actually it's not like me to feel super body conscious because usually I have that like deluge or mechanics I can grin it all the time lately just because I've always just changing ever so slightly I'm just not used to exactly how it is and I was feeling a little bit like but not bad or down but conscious like very aware of what I look like and what my like stomach and hips look like and having actually gained weight in pregnancy I gained a bit of weight before pregnancy so the last year I think and came to it betting I'm so happy and I mean just having a happy point in my life so I'm not you know I think sometimes getting it quickly happy and it was aware of that and feeling that conscious of it but now now's the worse time ever to try and go on like some crazy diet so I think I'm just going to us like get over it and think to myself I'm building a human I'm building a perfect gorgeous little human and not worry about it from the time I self got to go now because then it will be party time party teach I tell you what they're gusted I can't have any of those cocktails at the party I my little sister just mingling and mingling I got six rows of copies to go Michael Oh your head great

"no_LITERALLY WHAT BLOGGERS DO ALL DAY EVERY DAY"	"hey morning this is actually my very first time of vlogging on Oxford Street and I'm getting all the way looks right now so just gonna roll with it I'm holding my camera by my phone so I hope people think I'm facetiming or something but I'm not on Oxford Street at the moment it's about 10 o'clock in the morning and I'm meeting the lovely Tony from Bobby Brown now I've got an eyebrow appointment so obviously I had my brows tinted and waxed yesterday at benefit but Bobby Brown has launched a new range of makeup for the eyebrows so I'm going to go and have a chat with him about that and then I'm basically just got a full day of meetings ahead so should we go have fun and busy day but normally when I have a day of meetings I'm really bad at vlogging I always feel too awkward blocking during meetings so what I'm probably gonna do I'm probably gonna do it is do two days vlog in one so you'll get today and tomorrow in this blog and also because I'm filming or I'm putting live my South Africa lookbook yesterday on Wednesday is going to be myself the lookbook so yeah two days vlog in one so almost at Selfridges now so let's go and check out the new Bobby Brown Frank collection show you this step very wise about that Mara welcome to my cameras my I've had one brow done and one brow I'm gonna do myself look at the difference and then that 15 pounds is a deal rule against products so it's basically free products and it's not just a case of coming in trying to products they really teach you how to do it so I'm so excited to try this no concealer on me it's got perfect shape so there's me saying I've got rubbish brows but they are so many pretty chucked in my brows I'm putting up stairs now with me with another lady and then another meeting of that so I will blog as much as okay so we are now two meetings down and both meetings the girls complimented me on my eyebrows which has never happened to me in my entire life so bobby brown eyebrow consultation is definitely the one I'm just kind of hanging out outside yes they lured offices now because my friend Vicky works there and she's not replying to my texts around in French Connection so annoying they literally love that shop so much but when I purchase a top from Oxford Street store didn't have any and this woman I've literally been arguing with her for 45 minutes that I should be able to return X I brought it in that condition so annoying when things like that happen it really puts you off the shop but I'm not French Connection and I'm so excited to see my video on Sunday because I brought so many nice things but now I'm ready make my meeting and I asked her to change where it was I went to a meeting in Selfridges but because it was sunny earlier I said can we meet on the John Lewis rooftop so that's where I'm headed now 150 minutes late I hate being late so much so it's a few hours later now and I'm back home I've got changed into my comfy clothes got my tracksuit bottoms on and I don't know what it is but whenever I spend a full day in London my face always feels like really dirty at the end of the day so I'm gonna have a bit of a pump session I'm gonna use some little bits and bobs that I got from my meetings today so first thing I'm going to use is this face scrub and it's a brand called voya which I hadn't actually heard of before but but this one has got seaweed as the main ingredient which is really good for skin cells replenishing and it is a facial scrub so that should be really good at getting rid of all Gorrell that is in my skin from a day in the polluted city in the same meeting I got a little travel sized bottle of the dr. Bronner's I was called yeah dr. Bronner's magic soap which apparently is really good for cleaning makeup brushes so well I've got a face mask on I'm going to clean my makeup brushes and then I'm going to get into the bath and I'm going to use these bath salts I know this is the scrub so this is from a brand called West lab and me and Charlie already use their apps on bath salts because they're really good for like muscle ache but this body scrub is 98 pounds so I'm going to be putting it to the test and to be honest I can't imagine that a body scrub can be worth 98 pounds but we shall see it's meant to be detoxing so maybe I'll come out looking like a Victoria's Secret model here's hoping ooh and I nearly forgot to tell you a very exciting and delivery today finally I have my new camera I ordered a Canon 6d and these Sigma 35mm lens so I'm just so excited to start playing around with this the battery is currently charging as soon it's charged or probably in the morning when the lighting is bad it's dark outside now I'm going to have a play with my new toy so the first thing I'm going to do is take off most of my makeup using a no interpreter this is me she's my seller three in one so this is the face scrub from Roya it's called their love a scrub is to just apply it like a normal stroke so I'm just gonna put it on one to two pumps massage thoroughly for one minutes and then rinse up okay so I've been scrubbing that on for about a minute they've got quite nice small beads in it which is nice because it feels like doing a real good scrub but it's not too harsh on the skin and now I'm just gonna get a face cloth and rinse it off so now I'm going to do a thief mask I'm using the origins mask you miser this is like a master primer so you spray on your face and a Musial face to be able to more easily absorb the brigade's from your face mask but it makes your face mask what better I don't really know if it works but I use it anyway mud exfoliating mask I haven't used this in ages and I used to really love it oh maybe not it's all dried out okay I'm gonna go find another mask okay take two going to use the Amora vixa ultra more than mud masks and this is such a favorite mask really really good if you have any bad skin areas I don't really at the moment my skin is okay but I do need a good clean so I'm gonna put some in the salt so this is a really super thick mud so I'm looking suitably staring at my face masks on and this is one of those amazing ones you can actually feel it working so my face is tingling a little bit now movies is on for about minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna go and do some tidying up in my bedroom there's a little bit of appetizer actually last time I used this and didn't tingle quite so much so maybe the origins has actually made it work or maybe it's kind of activated the ingredients the room is tidy and I'm finally just relaxing my face mask is nearly dry so I'll go in the shower in a couple of minutes so I've just realized I've made a massive faux pas I've left my white roll neck top on which I need to get off with my face mask so that's gonna be interesting I'm just snuggling in bed now with my favorite little boy and Parks and Recreation on the iPad Charlie's just was washing his face mask off in the shower so yeah I think I will end today's part of the vlog now and see you guys in the morning for this vlog part good morning so it is bright and early on Wednesday morning and I'm currently in a nice fridge I am rushing towards Paris I've already 10 minutes late there is a bloody ISM event we like a bit of a rebel inherence before the shops even opened nobody in here I just go and try on theirs above aunty no Chanel or just live my childhood dream and play in the toy Kingdom for few hours now time for breakfast look at this beautiful table set valerian scramble they oh shit how do you today Sabrina and we're heading into town to go to the Monica at the sample sale which last year was really good actually think I went two years ago yeah I didn't go last year but I where Monica made them all the time as you guys know so I'm excited to pick up some new bargains little goodie bag from the Charlotte Olympia event with a gym talk some gym trainers nice little tote bag and a clean and lean book so that was going to be some nice holiday it's not visit recipe good so don't flick through that all the way around here all the way up to the top of the hill okay we are inside the building each other so we're just comparing what we thought Sabrina found the bracelet that says Sabina on it and I've got one that says the unicorn carat they're only ten pounds when they're engraved instead of just to come out of these sample sale it's so scary how quickly things add up everything was around like 30 pound pounds and sub standing like an orange acquitted so feeling a little bit naughty but I have got notice oh yeah money well spent and I could easily have spent just one thing in store so good back here I'd say those are pretty well organized so you know yeah we only queue for like 25 minutes really yeah yeah hardly any queue at the till if you ever go to sample cells let me take cash because there was no queue for cash but there was like a 20minute queue for card so oh and definitely always arrive early because we arrived about foot but when it was meant to start and we still had to Kim that was good fun I'm now heading to the river island style studio and I'm gonna pick out cupids and bobs for Lanzarote which is tomorrow so yeah that's good shipping based on in the stylus studio I've got all my bits and bobs that I've just grabbed from the shop floor along here so I've picked up this lovely blue and white I'm always thinking like a beach dress it's got a nice would you call this kind of straw woven belts which is very 70s boho style then I picked up this lace blouse which I think again I look really nice over a bikini a nice weight to cover up then behind here we've got a crocheted top I just loved crochet tops and I think that looks so nice with highwaisted trousers and this is actually a couple sizes too big for me but I'm gonna try it on just to see the style is very Mazzoni inspired kind of Tommy Hilfiger 2016 summer collection style as is this actually this again is a little bit too big for me a couple sizes too big but I thought I would try it on and then maybe the girls can find me the right size also got a bikini really like revile in bikinis it's not too wide on the bum so you still get a bit of a tan and the top is just a kind of white lacy detail then I grabbed a couple of bags I've got this one here this one's quite pricy actually this one's 60 pounds but I thought it was really pretty very again close Chloe boho style and this one as well I think I prefer this one though and I probably won't get to so we shall see tried on my first dress absolutely loved this one it definitely looks like a Mazzoni print this is a couple sizes too big for me which means it's on the floor I think maybe if I'd have got my size it probably would be maybe swinging around the ankles but I do quite like it as a maxi dress although I've definitely put it on wrong because I think this is a lining but I might just cut the lining out because I think I'm gonna wear this on holiday and I might get a little bit hot if I have a lining on as well here is the next one this would definitely have to be worn over a bikini because it's very very high on thighs either that and we'd like a pair of denim shorts or something but I really really like this it's gonna be so nice for on the beach and just exploring new tropical towns that kind of thing here is the proper top it's very cropped so I feel like I look like a bit of a belly dancer when I'm wearing this but I think with some highwaisted trousers this would look really cute and then we have the lace blouse this is the kind of thing I wear all the time on a holiday on the beach over a bikini and also doesn't look too bad just with jeans as well.if I definitely need to wear a vest top because you can see my brow quite clearly and last thing that I'm trying is this coat and immediately I have fallen in love with this it's so me absolutely love the shape of it the color it's got quite high slits as well so it's nice and airy around that but absolutely love that high waist love the sleeves love everything about this coat so this is definitely going in my to buy pile and lastly I've just tried on this sandal a common world for both of them on and absolutely love these as well I've been looking for something like this quite a long time and these are really good value I think they're only about 50 pounds 40 pounds for these sandals so good just got home and you can probably hear like a stirring noise outside because the guys are just finishing off our lawn it looks amazing it's quite bright a little bit unnatural but apparently it'll kind of like soften and tone em so it looks so good I will show you in a second so the last time I spoke to you was before I went through island or in River Island I got loads of one at loads I got a few really nice goodies from River Island which I will just quickly actually I won't show you because you just saw them a minute ago you'll see them in my land Zarate vlogs because I'll be wearing them and then I went to the boat impress day which was so much fun they had loads of really beautiful colorful things for autumn/winter collection and they had corn flake flavoured milk shakes which were amazing so that was super fun now I'm back home I came home via Dajjal I'm out of breath because I just carried about seven bags home so I'm gonna have a little unpack of some vlogger mail and I will show you the highlights and I'm also going to play with my new camera I'm gonna take some ill photos and I will show you how they come out let's go and see the new lawn thank you lightly much for the first where he suggested malaria what do you think your new lawn Dexter yeah yeah really so this is our new dawn it looks very realistic even got like little dried bits in it as well lovely gosh it looks so good it's it's so warm it literally feels like tropical sponge Charlie's already landscaping yeah we should get a few actually I was thinking what we'll do you know I was looking online I'll show you here look at this kind of bamboo bamboo so you know the bamboo that's like this is shit back here's a closeup of our new grass so as you can see it's got almost like brownie bits in it which makes it look so real it's actually multi little bit the moment I think that was starting the show now and we've even got a spare roll it's quite a big roll see your mum loved this place there that one man me yeah right in the corner there what do you mean that can't be touching other things so oh I see yeah that's true yeah all right I've done some serious unboxing I actually did a bit of a snapshot haul snapchat unboxing so if you want to see my proper unboxings and always follow my snapchat because I thought that goes from here on the bed because that's why I tend to do it but I did leave everything else I could quickly show you guys as well firstly a quick mention of what I got in the Monaco van at a sample sale I have packed some of it away and I bought a new cluster of bracelets so these are normally over 100 pounds each but the maximum Dexter maximum I spent was about 35 pounds so I got well you can see there there's the one really how to describe them so the top one is like a white bar on a rose gold chain the next one is like a labradorite kind of gem again on a rose gold chain which matches a necklace that I've got and then the bottom one is one of their classic friendship bracelets which was engraved it says the unicorn carrot on it God knows why anyone would get that engraved but yeah it was 10 pounds because it was engraved so really good value I also picked up a load of new rings you guys know I wear Monaco vanator rings every single day I've been wearing these too for like over a year so now I have some new rings and I also bought some earrings and some bracelets to give to my mum and my friends so I will really quickly whizz over the highlights of the bits that I was sent today first of all the new Bobby Brown brow collection you guys saw earlier in this vlog I got my brows done there so they've sent me the products that they used on me so I can recreate it at home as well as their new eyeshadow palettes which are absolutely stunning then we have a new range from red consol about volume whether you want like feature waves or really smooth volumes that's a new line from red can American Eagle sent me some inflatable beverage boats for like I don't know hot tubs or swimming pools as well as a pair of lovely ripped jeans I absolutely love American Eagle jeans so that's amazing and also they sent me cover the tops but where I put them oh yeah they're here ready she packed so it got a lovely white lace top and also more of a boho kind of style they're ready to go in my packing box for Lanzarote I got the look fantastic beauty box which I've opened up it had a wet and dry hair brush in it Allen magazine comes with l every month also it came with a little Vichy moisturizer a Rennes sample a red chem sample a sample and also these little sachets of moisturizer from a brand called hyoma what were you doing down there what have you got he's been showing the box what have you got I was also sent some bikinis by simply beach including including this Melissa Oda bash one which I remember is so beautiful on the website so I'm gonna try that on now and also this one from a brand called water cult and I think this one is sea folly yeah see folly one so I'm going to give those a try in a second and mumu also sent me their latest fragrance launch as well as a very handy holiday sized mini and they also really cutely put in like a perfume bottle with some lily of the valley in it which is really beautiful and lily of the valley is the main ingredient but also a symbol of luck and happiness I think that's a really nice little stand out so they're the highlights of the bits that I was sent I said sent today but this is about four days worth of bits and bobs I just went down to dawdle today I'm now going to tidy this up crack on with some emails and then I'm probably going to go out later to an EOS lipbalm texture launch but it depends if I get enough packing done so I'm gonna be productive and I will see you guys over later what you got there darling it is pasta chicken mashed carrots testa that's much carrots yeah oh my gosh that looks very good did you get a good Instagram photo oh good it is it's a few hours later now and I am so lucky in energy today I have pretty much packs I just need to like really think about those last few things and then I'm done I've done load of emails I would have liked to have got a blog post written as well but I just haven't had time I also would have liked to have done some photography but I just haven't had time everything takes so much longer than you think Charlie's just made a really nice dinner which I just quickly showed you he got sent this thing someone contacted him on Instagram I think it's a con but I'll get him to tell you the name of the company because they basically send you all the ingredients for these meals and you cook in my home and they're really healthy so that sounds and looks and smells really good but I needed some carbs so I was like we need to have some pasture in there as well so we're gonna have dinner now and then we're just gonna have a normal evening watch Parks and Recreation watch some scandal and then go to bed and then I'm up right in early tomorrow morning to go to the airport because I'm going to Lanzarote with Thomas cook on a blubber trip so that it should be really good fun I think I'm gonna film like come fly with me kind of video like how I do my makeup my outfit and all that jazz I have a feeling this is going to have been a super duper long vlog so if you made it to the end then you deserve a massive highfive so leave a comment with high five in there somewhere if you made it to the end of this vlog because I bet not many people do and you are in a minority so thank you for watching I'm gonna end it here in case I didn't say that already because the rest of the season is gonna be quite boring I need to edit this so yeah I'm gonna end the vlog now and I will see you guys in two morons one which should be a really good fun one goodnight bye did you want to go for a wee on your noon or Oh mommy nope I'm just seeing if there's a fox here mmm I'm just staying everywhere apart from the new lawn this is Dexter's first we on his new lawn he never boy give a sausage jug"	4310
"no_London Fashion Week Vlog  Blogger Mail Unboxing  FASHION MUMBLR.txt"	"good morning everybody welcome to a new day of log this is going to be my London Fashion Week September 2017 vlog it is Sunday today I'm actually only doing two fashion weekdays this season today and tomorrow so that I'd bring you along with me I've had a very nice start to the day we drove up home from my mom's house this morning because Charlie and I just got back from Kefalonia yesterday so stayed at my mom's house last night and first thing this morning I went to meet my best friend Vicky we went to London grace which is my fav nail salon here in Clapham and we both got manis so very very happy with my new nails I went for the shade called Coco which is like a brownie pink I felt be really nice for autumn their manicures just last me so long the last one I had on for like 4 weeks and I only had to get her a face because of regrowth so highly recommend that so really nice morning we had a coffee afterwards and then two little boys shopping around Kevin High Street so now it's around half one and I'm going to head into London I'm heading to Chinatown first to go to the apartment which is kind of like a chill out relax and reenergize area space for bloggers and they should have a hair station there so hopefully I'm going to get some of the guys there to do my hair because I washed it this morning and it's just super silky just chucked it in a barn to get myself there today is the Topshop fashion Church I'm really excited about I'm only doing three shows this season I've just checked the one star really but you want to do and of course Topshop is on I'm so excited about i'm wearing my Topshop dress and that is this afternoon so I'm very much looking forward to taking you along to that so I guess without further ado let's get going and I'm home again that that was a whirlwind afternoon so much fun at the top shop show although it was roasting in there my skin feels disgusting I don't know if it's because I've been away and now suddenly the pollution is going back into my skin but I just feel like I want to exfoliate and put on face masks which is pretty much what I'm going to do but yeah top shot was fabulous I was invited by L'Oreal and the stylist Duffy did their hair it looked beautiful it's just like very cool girl waves which I definitely need to recreate so Thank You L'Oreal for inviting me I was sat opposite Phillip green and Kate Moss so it's just really really cool experience and yeah fab start to London Fashion Week I'm gonna head upstairs now put a face mask on and I think I'm gonna unbox a little bit of blogger mail so I will show you what is in my blogger mail but first of all I need to put on some comfy clothes and chill out okay so I'm gonna start by putting this one on it's the fresh black tea instant perfecting mask because I've got a few blemishes on my chin which hopefully this will zap and get rid of and then I'm gonna double wammy it I'm gonna put this one on which is the vitamin nectar it's not focusing there we go this one is a vibrancy boosting mask which I feel like these two work really well together so you can apply this one just to cleanse and this one it'll bring back the glow so let's start with this bad boy right so I'm going to leave this on my skin and for the first 10 minutes well that works its magic I'm gonna attack my blogger mail I'm too embarrassed to even show you what the floor of this room looks like so let me prop you up somewhere and I'll show you a few of the bits and bobs I have arrived over the past week obviously while we've been away it's kind of built up a little bit so let me show you what is in a week's worth of blogger my how I ended up faffing about with my hair and I'm already onto face mask number two which is the vitamin one and it looks like I have some kind of weird skin condition so forgive me um also funny story as I was taking off my first face mask I realized that I was using the flannel that we used to use to wipe the carpets clean after Dickens had done a poo on the carpet so luckily it's been washed but not a good start to the face mask session but nevermind hopefully this will draw out any poo toxins anyway it's my first vlog Amell is a really really cool one I just opened it up eagerly already from Bobby Brown it's a new lipstick launched and they have sent so many this is absolutely crazy there's two drawers in here you've got the Reds some purples and I've pulled out this one which is called bear this is the new crushed lip color which apparently is very hydrating it's got vitamins and beeswax in there so really good for this time of year I feel like quite a lot of brands are bringing out really hydrating lip products at the moment which I am very okay with because I'm all about comfort on the lips but I am also a really big fan of matte lips so it's nice to kind of switch it up with something like this so very much looking forward to trying these out super generous from Bobbi Brown all these lipsticks I don't know what I'm gonna do with them all but figure out which shades are the best actually this one looks beautiful as well look at that gorgeous kind of like a Barbie pink color very excited to try those I feel like it can be a little bit more adventurous with barmy colors as well because it's not such a bold color on the lips next bloggers mail again I've just opened two already because I didn't know I was gonna film this earlier on today is a beautiful silk pajama set from a new brand called leis this is their blank or Blanc white short set and I'm just such a huge fan of silk pajamas I feel like you feel so amazing when you go to sleep in such beautiful material and then it's got a navy stitching or navy hem around the collar a little bit of detail on the chest here I think that's retails for under pounds of sets I believe I will leave a link down below so you can have a look for yourself but very affordable for how highquality it feels and then it's little pair of shorts as well so thank you very much to lase or when they also very very kindly popped in a matching eye masks on oh look so cute in my matching PJ's then I'm dying to see what's in this I have a huge blogger mail gift from River Island you guys know how much a lover of Island I I waited too much stuff from there but it looks like this is actually a present from them dear Josie we wanted to send you a little something in the spirit of London Fashion Week good timing see you on the other side love from River Island PR alright oh my goodness wow this is not something I would usually go for so it's pretty awesome that they've sent it because I would not have even tried this on in the store it's like a Czech blazer very cher Horowitz clueless style and oh my gosh I think this is a pair of like paper bag waist culottes or Hauser's very very smart I don't know if I can pull this off maybe the trousers with like silk shirts or something silk blouse could look pretty cool I'll give those a try tomorrow morning I'm only doing one more day of Fashion Week so this could also work for a work where lookbook that I'm planning for you guys so yes thank you so much for island forever pushing my style boundaries and now I'm gonna use this box as my rubbish bin so I'm dying to see what's in this one because it's from Kiki K and I am obsessed with that station I don't think I ever got a gift from them before so this is pretty awesome looks like nothing hi Josie we hope you like your new personalized diary oh my god it's getting to that time of year I'm so excited to see this oh that is so cute oh my gosh so this is a 2018 diary and they have put my initials jf down in the bottom there I so gorgeous very sleek as well in the gray I would normally again go for pink but because I wear so much pink maybe it's a little bit more chic that I gave something a bit more neutral just as yours expect lots and lots of space for your appointments I've actually had kqk Diaries in the past and loved them so thank you very much for sending that that will be very very well used in the next year and months what is in here vonda's I actually had so many compliments on my tan today I think people thought that I've been sunbathing one in kefalonia but actually I just had a bottle of bondo sans ultra dark with me so that's why I'm tanned so I think I might have a toke up here this is liquid gold I have not tried this one before but actually I'm gonna give this a go tonight I've heard so many good things about this and I'm actually having to cancel the spray tan that I was meant to have on Wednesday and also there's selftanner razor which I did a huge long Instagram story about with my first impressions and it's amazing it really really works so that's epic thank you very much to Bondi Suns dear Josie please find enclosed your adorn gift enjoy wearing boo so a door is a brand that is like a sister brand to Swarovski I worked with them a little bit last Christmas and I love their designs and I was very excited to see an email from them asking me to pick a favorite piece and I chose oh my gosh it's even more beautiful in real life this beautiful bangle it's um not sure off my camera will focus on it but there we go so it's like a layer of clear Swarovski crystals and then a layer of pinky ones in this rose gold band it looks so beautiful I look like an absolute mess whose face masks on and actually this is Swarovski this is well this is a door but with Swarovski crystals this is Swarovski remix and it's part of their range that has little magnets so you could technically make a whole long necklace of these if you wanted to really mix and match the clasp is just like a magnet but yeah that's from actual Swarovski and then this is a new one from a door which I adore so thank you very much so those guys I'm feeling like the luckiest girl in the world like I always do when I open blogger mail I think that a lot of people look at this and maybe it makes them think oh blogging is so easy and you get sent all this stuff but it's really not like that like I blogged for two years before a brand even reached out to me and even when I got sent my first everything I could not believe it I'd never ever ever will take this for granted so yeah it's definitely a perk of the job and something that I feel forever grateful what is this Clinique post summer Thursday skin and discover 24/ hydration with Moisture Surge I'm such a huge fan of such a huge fan of Moisture Surge something else that is personalized Josie's supercharged notes I love this and he can personalized I just go crazy for and the color of this notebook so beautiful that's gorgeous very much gonna put that to good use and then I wish I'd open this earlier I could have put this on now Moisture Surge overnight mask I will be using that tonight think they've put in some cute little pink Clinic pencils I'm such a stationery nerd this gets me really excited and then we've got moisture smaller Moisture Surge extended thirst relief this is so good for longhaul flights if you're going on any long journey is on an airplane you don't want your skin to get dehydrated and dried out just put some of this in a little Muji pot it is honestly a savior and then this is the Moisture Surge serum hydrating supercharged concentrate this is the perfect time of year to really get a hydrating serum because obviously autumn we have heating and then you go outside in the cold release sucks all the moisture out of your skin so you want to keep it glowing and this would be a great thing to add to your beauty routine so I'm definitely gonna put that somewhere safe so I can start hydrating my skin on daily basis back again I didn't realize this is actually an oilfree gel you can use this like a daily moisturizer it's a really good if you just need hydration but you don't want to have too much

to fit skin that sounds good and my skin is in need about at the moment I have got those like annoying under skin spots although my skin does feel very cleansed and smooth after that face mask session that sounds like a really good idea I'm excited to give that a go how many is done Logica in a long time either okay I just had to change the battery on the vlogging camera and I've undone a load more bits and bobs so I'm just gonna whiz through a few pieces first of all this lovely blog amount from Viktor and Rolf which probably my favorite fragrance of all time is flower bottom they have so kindly sent the perfumed body lotion and for me applying a body lotion with the fragrance is such a nice way of making it last a lot longer and stronger this is the shower gel and then also these two little boxes with their travel mini so that's going to be very handy for my Hamburg might pop that in my fashion we come back for tomorrow so thank you very much to Victor and roll and then elements have absolutely spoiled me rotten I mentioned in my previous autumn beauty routines I loved their dynamic resurfacing moisturizer and she sent me the rest of the range which is so generous this is the dynamic resurfacing night cream with tri enzymes white truffle renews smoothes and nourishes I'll be giving that a go and there's a dynamic resurfacing serum facial wash and gel mask I did not notice a whole range but apparently so and cannot wait to try those then I got a really lovely blog amount from a brand called Catherine Daniels and this was probably one of the first brands I tried when I started testing out skincare on my blog and I loved their products this is their new instant effect I mask which promises a 70% reduction in wrinkles 80% revitalize skin and 80% plumped up skin so that sounds amazing again gonna try these tonight we have a new fragrance as well from jeanpaul Gaultier this is scandal and it comes in this amazing like faux suede or maybe it's real suede tin which is probably gonna be a nightmare to get into oh there we go oh my goodness looks like something out of Moulin Rouge so he's got this leg design coming out the lid beautiful pink coloured fragrance that's how chef it's kind of like a sweet floral fragrance I would say but then as you wear a little bit longer it gets a little bit more musky very very nice I think that's definitely gonna be a nice one of for autumn and this packaging really really cool big fan of that and then the last piece I'm going to show you guys is this one and then I'm gonna go downstairs finish unpacking and just chill out a little bit because Charlie has just got home also that scandal now that it's sunken is so lovely I feel like is a little bit sweet to start with but now I've been wearing it for a few minutes it just smells absolutely gorgeous and typically I have another fragrance this one here is Michael Kors sexy Ruby this is like a giant jewelry box really really cool got these little drawers oh my goodness wow that is seriously cool so down here up don't me I was meant to pull that out put a mini of the fragrance but I think that's actually a USB stick what is that is that one of those what are they called I don't know but it's pretty oh my god can you see that it looks like something out of the demon head master like an illuminated crazy fragrance lightup thing that is very very cool so how do I actually get to the perfume oh my goodness looks like loads of different gems inside that is pretty damn cool so sexy Ruby it looks like a giant Ruby the actual bottle oh that was totally different to the other one that I've sprayed on a lot lighter oh well that is almost like Tobacco 8 I feel like this is one that Charlie would really like as well oh that was really cool it's almost like a clean laundry mixed with tobacco smell I don't know how to describe it it's very very cool see my face illuminated by this too lovely new fragrances which I will wear and to keep you updated on my thoughts on but overall a fabulous selection of blogger mail pieces I'm gonna have a big tidy up session now because this room is a bomb site I haven't even showed you the stuff that I've bought

Macdonald show has just finished and what a way to end Fashion Week it was the craziest like nineties party I was definitely the least cool person they're definitely dancing along different songs while everyone else acting cool but since I last spoke to you I went and got my hair done I had my roots highlighted as the wonderful Bridget Ward and they put a physio treatment on my hair but hopefully will help with the conditions and getting a bit of breakage recently from holidays sunshine that was a really good way to just catch up so afternoon while they were doing my hair and then I went home for a very very quick change and then back into London for the Julien Macdonald show which was amazing and definitely the most fun show of the season although we had to keep like half an hour and the show was running an hour late it was amazing as if I saw just so many beautiful designs on spark and now I'm heading back home again and that marks the end all that this September's the Fashion Week's I hope you enjoy coming with me for the few shows I did go to yeah double for me thank you for watching and I'll see you very soon in the next one"	4760

members of a stupa just stayed up so all day in our PJs and had a Chinese and then yesterday I was shooting so it was stupidly left my blogging camera and Alana's up leave it much much we just shot some Beauty free stuff and Phil's videos very very dull anyway but today me and her together with my mum my auntie and my cousin and my Nana gave is my Nana's official a professor you saw a load about on Sunday but today's our actual big day so we're in couple field in Manchester very nervously right now in sprinkles and it's a bit chilly and muslin which summer to dinner lunches and drinks so better update I feel awake back when I was younger this was my dream house and it's still pretty much is it's right on the canal it was used to imagine like Rosie and Jim with liver is so cute and look at that blossom tree yeah honey I also saw I'd point out that got a new Mac palette today has that green in it not keen to put it on almost a while I do it fear and little bit selfconscious a not pin to the screen at all fails beautiful regardless here's a strategically blending into her surroundings matching her fluffy knit to the chair unintentional also in traditional run out my my basic bitch oh yeah all can I be me crew no can't you can't sit with us and I thank ya big one earlier when I lost again like a fivetime another santa came in after in Hazel McCallion 4000k was like nice they have a management we're literally opposite of the way Aires yeah that I'm announcing now they just brought out some I the cute ever happy birthday to you happy birthday yeah good morning everybody today is Thursday and I feel like this week has been a little bit of a vlogging fail I don't know I've not added anything yet this week's have been mental with all the celebrations none of them look as I've had in last week's vlogs I was kind of getting prepared last week and weep for for a bit of a manic week this week and then next week on the way this week feels like I've done absolute zero work because I've been celebrating but I did make up for it the past two weeks so stop feeling guilty Megan but yeah and I don't really know I've no expertise lot goes up tomorrow morning and have not touched the Edit so have no idea I've got enough or whatever I really rejoined anyway but last night was incredible yesterday cement follow some really nice lunch at cheeks 92 which is a lovely place to go in the summer however it wasn't funny so it was very very quiet but they've got this made in like outdoor patio area which is huge and it always round in the summer it was a little bit quiet and bit by Bluffs and and we went on to revelation to Cuba which is a Cuban version of like mod Koretz but much of what cool I must say really delicious cocktails a twoforone lovely I had some gin and hi cocktail and a banana and as daiquiris going and these mango punch things it was a marvelous hello and it was really really nice and then we moved unto you albatross which next door which is ridiculous because I've been an albatross in this blog as a whole three times now this week I do love that place it's like nowhere else never been it's like a huge huge room with a bar in the middle it's always packed and I've never ever ever in my entire life of drinking so since LeMay p16 I have been to a bar that caters for everyone let you go in and there's no pretense there's no like you don't feel selfconscious you walk in and everyone having a great time if one's there for a good time you don't feel out of place and it caters for literally everyone like groups or large groups of girls couples all the people like mine an old you know there's no age I've just never know in a place to like get it so spoton and cater for everybody like the music is great but it's not for a certain type of person I don't know it just means I'm live in there so I'd highly recommend that if you're in Manchester's because I think it's my favorite by of an entire type rooty of Manchester offensiveness of course it's different bytes Jim it all together so looked in there and we went in and I just said to the guy look it's my men of eight year and it was really busy by the way the man of 8co shorts a change of scenery what we have to have a table because she's easy and they were like yeah no problem they gave us a boo they might reject their with reservations round so we get out of booze they gave my Nana 2 free bottles of Prosecco we'll all three to three bottles and second which is just like next level kind of service and then they gave red cake and cake ice cream thing and sang happy birthday stop which you've all seen but I just thought I really like to shout it out because that kind of level of service if you don't get everywhere like we can get in the other two places where that yesterday about how there's loss just brilliant we had an amazing and the hosts I think he was called Joss and he was great so shouts just because he was mint and I think credit where credit do because he was just wonderful everyone in that I just had a really good time basically and I'm highly recommend checking out which loss and hashtag list is not about I'm going to go meet my mom and sister for hmm lunch which is lovely it's nice when the months of work at the same time as mephista be enough work because obviously I'm selfemployed so I can find my holidays around that so yeah we're going to go and have a nice afternoon together get some yummy food and that is about it but I've got this amazing jumper on how cool is that to meet um I think there's about 10 pounds I'll show them out okay pop shoes on in Macao we need to go and meet them that will show you my outfit because I'm a bit this is what I'm wearing today I've got this little cute micced really fine knit each stripe jump with these amazing report sleeves I think it is so cute from H&M as I said and then I've got my Swedish House being flyable and I think these are so flattering they really elongate the leg especially with a good old platform boot Lisa from a soft years ago now but my old trusty faithfuls and yeah I like this I can't decide what jacket to I was going to wear like a dusty pink justic oh just need us to go but I don't know if it makes it look a little bit more basic the outfit just wish it was warmer so they could just go out like this but he was that or a leather jacket and I think I'm going to wear my good old Stella McCartney Falabella bag say a mummy that's what I'm talking about oh yeah huh no just in a slots shopping I bought something Azzaro mommy mango and saying hey Raja Nair focus image of all around and whilst was variously lovely lunch in Russia very very deep and now the long from the drop of me back home which is on the road and so

"no_Making a big change....txt"	"hi pretty girl ah what are you do give me enough smile hey Sal how the cats let me see let's see there's nitro cane wears tux tux oh gosh what's up talks open the door Empire Kunis a absolutely beautiful hi baby hi flashy what's up my man what's up bud Oh Oh mr. jealous flash got to get in on it you got to get on it flash get him in get him in it's the race on whoa there you go that's Jarvan son weird we have had we have had reigned for so long the dirt is like sand leave this run boy run today's gonna be very very strange I want to talk with you about some things that I dread even bring it up because I already know your response I'm kind of scared of you right now I'm at least kind of come down here so I can watch change nope get some jumps for you guys ready little man send it nice and easy get some speed all geez there you go my nice dude here's my idea guys and I know that most of you are gonna love it some of you gonna actually maybe it's the other way around unless you're gonna hate it some are you gonna love it I had this idea for a while where basically I want to start creating more episodic vlogs more not how do I explain this more not like TV more like you know story base flogs where we we may take 23 days to film one vlog rather than so you're trying to tell me to get straight to the point it's more or less like a document days that's a great jacking and focus on you guys right now cuz I love our Caesar I'm talking about like longer storyline vlogs where maybe they take two three date maybe the vlog is us starting here and we end up in you know in a camper that goes across the country and we document all of that rather than each day I feel like it would be so much more fun for me especially me maybe I'm being stingy here but to create longer bigger more fun episodes especially on days where we're just not doing anything here at our house we literally not doing anything some days and the only days I'm really doing nothing or after days that I have been just pounding and going so hard whether Britt and I are smile more nonstop we're vlogging we're doing other projects and and all these big things here's my idea it's not gonna take immediate effect or maybe never I may never do it but what is your guys's thoughts on maybe just for a month me trying to do maybe three episodes a week instead of seven I would love the opportunity to attempt bigger Longer vlogs with story and and you know my family and travel and whatever is whoo so I don't know exactly what I'm saying or what I'm asking from you guys I think that mentally maybe I just want to start creating more episodic vlogs rather than just this is we're not doing anything today or we're doing something exciting or I can't show you this I can't show you that I'd rather just take you guys on journeys whether it's here at the house or we're traveling or whatever it is I'd rather focus on much cooler content you know when I'm when I'm vlogging each day or trying to vlog each day it's really just about making a vlog for you guys so that there's something to upload rather than being creative and making it fun and and having a blast and just coming off the big projects I think it's just maybe worn me out a little bit and I haven't wanted to pick the camera up as much or just like I've been gone and the kids are like you've been gone so much can we just hang out offcamera and each time I hear that from the kids or whoever it is it's like yeah of course I'm gonna film I'm not gonna film if you guys don't want me to felt like that of course absolutely but I feel like if we could bring in like day's worth of footage and put up maybe two three videos a week where it's like bigger longer and more fun I think it'd be better for everybody including my family you guys would have much more content to watch each time so I guess what I'm saying is keep an open mind to the idea of maybe you know honestly I'm not uploading every day as it is like I upload I try to and I'm doing pretty good like I miss a day or two every two weeks but I would love to just try it you know not permanent maybe maybe I won't even do it but I would love to try I think it could be a lot of fun for everybody including you guys we just be able to create such bigger pieces bigger episodes it'd be more like watching an episode of Roman Atwoods vlogs rather than just another day and Roman outwits life so tell me what you guys think you know I'm just coming to you openminded here this is just something I've been thinking about you to spa asked me with mud yeah so that's it I'm gonna end it right there tell me what you guys think obviously it's you know people including you and I we always hate change so if I was to change something on this channel probably catch a lot of flack for it maybe rightfully so maybe I would deserve it but I hope you guys give us some thought they could be great I think it'd be fun it also give my family and I'm more time to create fun and and and be a family at the same time so tell me what you guys think about that otherwise try to keep these vlogs rolling for you until we make a decision but I don't know I love YouTube I love being here so either way we're gonna be here that's just how we're gonna keep it going you know what I mean so thanks for that we try to FaceTime Brit for you guys so you can see her today this can be very weird bad short vlog I don't know it's not bad school just hanging out yeah get it get it boy oh oh geez that's one way to break it in he blew his body off dude okay ray go back to the garage all right here we go I can do burnouts you good oh my gosh this thing flies I can literally just take off so buddy what's the what's going on up here I suppose what is this Madame's what's matter talk to me they're gonna need to put some overtime in what is this your weekly and I'm adding I'm adding up the pain it's just not right it's not maybe somebody's getting in your drawer I think I think you're right some he washed it up so what you want to put in some overtime this week or what cuz we can get yeah well if you if you got the hours off I'll give you the time there's your culprit right there look at him sneaky sneaky flash over here you you must have raccoon in you that's what it is crank it up crank it up full speed crank it up you want you did pretty

her up my noxious voice I want you to say hi to all the viewers before I go how'd it go good yes wait all right well see really soon I love you too bye so guys he's broken up in here that is glass yikes that is it for today guys like I said please please please give this some thought like some serious thought let's you know maybe don't just shut it down immediately I know probably your instinct is be like no I want daily vlogs that's what this channel is that's what you promised us and I understand that and maybe that's just what it continues to be but please just think about it give us some thought maybe we at least try it we try go ahead donkey all wait she just just just think about this all I'm asking like get some thought and at the end of the day it's gonna be you know it's really gonna be about what the kids and Brit and everybody wants to really do because if we're excited it's just more for this right here so I want to keep everybody excited watch out for glass baby come here sit with me sit with me do you love you guys so much please please give this video some extra love because it is weird it's different and that little thumbs up give it a little little love say we

adorable who you spend the day together today yeah just had a very successful meeting I like to think and also today's the day you could say is Tuesday be hunting fifth of what month we in April May April April and I'm finally able to tape up a book videos going out to night you're promising this video in a few days time so I can finally tell you about it and I'll link to that the demos you can check it out on hear all about it both call 247 things basically full of things from the inside of my brain kind of covered everything from little anecdotes that lessons I've known through life to the science of heartbreak and there's bits on testicles and there's bits on bumblebees and does everything that I find exciting and fascinating and yeah really fun to tell about it and I hope you had like it is but I'm not sure when the finger is going up but if it if there's time I'll put a link to a website and go to check out it's running for a hundred forty seven hours if they do a little survey where I'm collecting information and then writing things about it in the book there's also other information going to be on that website too for like cover announcements and tour dates and all that stuff as we find out so yeah also a link to preorder if you want to preorder it it's good I like it I've been told it's a good book by people who are reading it so um yeah really happy to finding it's tell you about it so check out that video because it's totally worth watching and explain that much better than I just did we're leaving because somebody here can't stop barking whenever the door goes at homes you bought their own office the doors constantly going so she's liking a lot so we're taking a home because it's just not conducive to a work environment is it huh you're going home okay I ended up not taking my home Aston's didi take mother home because they did going to work from home and seeing as Tom chemically off it and although 1ups into a time I haven't really seen her much lately we've gotta be like parking ships I've been getting home and she's been going out and viceversa so we're actually going to steal a few hours and then hang out and do something nice for thinking afternoon tea or are you sure yet but I kind of think I'm not going to film this bit because I want quality time with milady so a little bit I'm back home we may have to steal a few hours we actually went to Claridge's for afternoon tea and it was lovely but now who ate your teeth I'm not getting any work done so I'm back in the office I'm going to open my lap so if I've got a ton of us replied to I'm going to write some book I'm getting toward the end of it I'm currently at like 85 thousand words which is actually more than I'm supposed to written I still got quite a lot to do in I'll burn through and edit loads out well that being said my editor who I'm working with on the book who basically reads everything I write and make suggestions and helps me to focus ideas said that seems really good so he's not really is not it might be longer than motivated basically and you're going to do some of that divine you nap top because when I was in LA my laptop kind of exploded again explode but just stopped working so I managed to reach them and I'd actually had written about three days worth of book stuff that then went missing and that do it all over again and then since then I've been back home that like a week and a half and I have to it just keeps freaking out on me and I've had it for three and a half years no 2014 I bought it at the 14 15 16 yeah but it for a long time and I use it every single day so I think a lighting a new one now it's kind of a noise this one's pretty proud but um it's just hanging in there is that over the weekend I had to arrange everything do a total hard reset or did the entire Hardware ever start again but it still isn't working properly so have to get a new laptop and then I have these two these three photos here let me show you these these are all my step that Brian who actually passed away in February and these are the only photos I have of him because he wasn't really a man who likes being in front of the camera it was only behind the camera he wasn't good with cameras but I miss him and I haven't got any magic Rafic evidence of him anywhere I believe I'm not even the best most like a client of him so annoyingly I bought these frames which are actually too small for the photo so that's an ultra yeah that's right there and then I'm going to watch Star Wars I forget the names the orders they come in but I told you that in my last vlog that I'm doing this um script writing course and I've got a mountain of films and TV shows to watch so I've watched God by the 1 & I've watched a few others or so or the first one which is a new hope right and now I'm watching this massive water second one which years Empire Strikes Back I want to say I can't remember the order they come in don't watch that tonight maybe two films but I can get out of it yeah that's what I'm doing that so I'm going to quickly come up these photos and then get a load of writing done I'm getting towards the end of Star Wars Airport right back at the time is now 8 o'clock so my video and now seeing my book went live an hour ago and the website still crashed which is really really exciting like I didn't know because you know lots of youtubers have written books now and I don't know I just kind of I didn't wasn't expecting that reaction I can't some people go yeah well done congratulations I didn't know everyone would kind of go up to the website and click and show the support and do the survey and there's another little section where you can write your name and hopefully get your name the book I'm picking like 147 names to go in the book and yeah an hour on and the website still crashing it's just really really lovely to know that you care that much so thanks very much never really appreciated it I'm really excited I was worries had a meeting with gleam this morning and we're talking about you know announcement book and everything else that I'm just worried that no one's gonna care of what really hardness is no longer than I thought or if no one that actually wants to read it in it but yeah it is really nice to know that you do so thank you very much if you are watching this now and you try to do the website thing before you couldn't because I get keeping you off I understand it be prostrating and if you haven't tried again maybe try to die and in my my work this time it will be you know day also since that video alive and there should be less traffic on the website now but just thanks it's really cool hey good morning so it's the next day now and I realized that I actually got to end yesterday's video after Star Wars I just kind of went to bed I must tell you that so yeah so you didn't miss much I'm going to quickly show you up here I've put my pictures of Brian up or two of them are up here look into one with my niece and nephew and one on my wedding day and there's another one of Mama Brian's wedding day up in my office just so you know he's got someone nice to sit in the house now yeah that's they I'm going to end the video now thanks very much for watching all the website updates by the way shortly after filming that clip saying I'll make the try when you watch this video the editors a Mactan villain remind my publishers there were particular websites and did something to it which means but it shouldn't crash anymore so yeah and also I think it kind of you know

"no_MORNING COFFEE & MOOD BOARDS  NYCBAMBI (VLOG 2).txt"	"good morning guys so today I'm going to be doing another blog because I just really loved the feedback on the last one and I feel like I don't know it was just something that you guys liked and I was totally in the mood to do one today so I just woke up and I did my morning routine and all that so now I got my coffee my coffee got my laptop and oh what is that I got a package that I really want to show you guys so I'm gonna open that right now okay so this package is from lack of color and they're an Australian brand that makes it cats oops this is gonna be so hard to open okay oh my god alright I might have to set you guys down and then kind of just show you what's inside so I'm very sorry there's this so nice already oh my god let's take it out though so I can show you that's properly Oh My Damn have you ever seen a hat looks so good I am really I'm feeling it right now yay cool cool cool I think I'm gonna hang it up there because it's so cute and I'm trying to make my like wardrobe more fall now even though I'm not trying to make it to fall because September is still hot as hell so I just want falling guys so today I honestly don't really know them doing I don't want it to be too much like the last vlog because I feel like that was just me you know running errands and everything but that might be what it is today I'm really not sure I have to go food shopping and shower and honestly that's basically it but hopefully it'll be more eventful than that I see I see countess I've been gone so I definitely want to take a flat life for this hat but what's up lying to do it I cleared off everything almost everything on this table because I feel like maybe I could do it flat lay this way but I'm gonna add some accessories to basically I'm giving you a behindthescenes right now of how I would take a flat lay of this um but it's kind of like trial and error as well okay so I added a vintage camera a book like a vintage antique book and a candle so I'm hoping that's gonna be good I don't know okay so I took some I kind of just changed it up a little bit like I took some from far away so I guess we will see if I like any of these and then I guess you will see based on if I Instagram now I'm working on a blog post I am so blah being oriented today I'm just really feeling inspired almost and yeah so this is gonna be a what's on my rack oh just because I kind of updated the rack a little bit and I just want to show you guys how I'm slowly transitioning kinda like I said before actually slowly transitioning away from summer pieces and kind of trying to incorporate all now I know August just started but I'm just feeling so unbelievably fall inspired oh you know it could be a fun thing also the little bulletin boards however here is just hanging necklaces which I like but at the same time it kinda gives me a little OCD because it's just all these necklaces I don't know I don't know does it give you guys I was seeing years I just literally me being crazy so I was thinking about making this an inspiration board and taking these necklaces and putting them in my closet somewhere maybe even like just on a hanger that would be such a nice thing to do today actually I'm really gonna think about that so I just finished the blog post and I did post a picture Jesus so this is the one I want with I honestly really really really like it just so calm I'm seriously I'm gonna turn into the shower now and then I'll probably go food shopping a little bit of food shopping that I have to do I literally have to get fruit and mac and cheese and that's it I basically just look like one big towel when I get out of the shower seriously hi guys so what here is my makeup very simple I didn't even put eyeliner on because I just wasn't feeling it but I did a little subtle pink eyeshadow and then let me show you okay so my outfit is very scholarly I feel like kind of preppy but I have this free people top and then these bright orange trousers from American Apparel they're really cute and then I got Zara flats and then just this like forever 21 bag that I got kind of a long time ago but I still I'm just in love with it and it's just a brown leather and that's it no accessories because I didn't want to do anything crazy but yeah so I'm gonna start my journey I'm gonna go get fruit and food and that's probably it hi guys so I am back from my little shopping extravagant not really I literally did not get that much stuff um I just got some mac and cheese and goldfish cuz it's literally what I live off of and then I got raspberries strawberries and like four bananas which is good because then I can just like make smoothies and then I was walking around New York City with this freaking huge like bushel of branches but I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do with them but they're so cute so I'm gonna unwrap them now and then I will show you guys what my plan is hey guys so I was gonna put those bushels in the like entryway right when you walk in but they just do not look right so I have them in this cute little watering can from Ikea just in this little corner because it is a pretty plain corner and in the hats right up there so I kind of like how it looks like that alright peeps so I cleared off my board I have my necklaces like hanging on a hanger now in my closet and I'm so ready to get this shit like done so I got my setup goldfish and my laptop and my printer I'm gonna go grab some scissors and maybe even tape and like pens and stuff and yeah I am so excited about this alright guys the mood board is done I am so happy with it it took me honestly almost an hour to actually do this whole thing because I just like it was kind of trial and error because some photos I didn't like in some places and then like I'd have to cut them out a certain way but I'm so happy with this one it's a little bit autumn inspired but it's also just kind of like color scheme that I love and I'm trying to go for all right guys I think I'm actually gonna end the vlog here just because I'm super tired and I'm not really feeling too well I haven't been feeling the best this weekend I think I've just been like running around nonstop so I'm gonna end it here um and I'm sorry because this probably not as long as the last one but I still hope you like that just as much I seriously love doing these so let me know what you guys want to see next week even if it's another vlog type just let me know ok love you and thanks for watching bye"	1396

Graham story in last night just when I'd completely finished everything I needed to do but yeah that's the reason for the lack of footage in this video I think I could do a little bit but I didn't do those I remember I don't really cook up my camera I just figured I would show you guys what I've done so far it's nothing major so please don't like think what I show you is the finished product because definitely not like there are so many things I still need to do but I really want to give you guys just an idea I will not upload because I miss you guys in a really long time and yeah I just

so back here is all the kitchen the utility room the bathrooms over there there's loads of like rubbish bags on the floor and stuff that we need to fill out but the lounge is pretty tidy so far so we have the island and now I was considering for ages whether or not to get bar stools or a dining table I went with a dining table so the one we have guests and everything over I can cook dinner for them we're gonna have some nice chairs to go here which are arriving next week I literally got this table this table is so amazing on actually novel it was like 80 pounds from eBay my gorgeous fake

330 pounds guys 330 pounds including delivery all the way from London I'll take this throw off just so you guys can see what it looks like how amazing is that you know I mean think they're foam cushions so they last longer it's just so amazing it's like a crushed velvet beautiful beautiful so far I love it so much brandnew amazing coffee table from bnm it actually has an LED light on it like that which I just turned on yeah I love that so much ice reed diffuser on it from the top drawer and the rug is also from BNN then there's the whole TV unit the TV units from Ikea our TV obviously

my DIY video and I really wanted to get some bedside tables but there isn't enough room for them well I'm thinking of just getting one and putting it on my side there but like a lamp I don't really know my beautiful mirror for my chaos and fake flowers there but this whole space is just like really big and spacious but it's also just it just feels very empty so I kind of want to make the bedroom my next project but I just don't know what to put here so if you guys have any ideas maybe a rug table there I don't know I'm gonna have to gonna have to think about that one you guys have any ideas as to how I can make the bedroom like you know just more me then let me know I don't think it'll take much of an s I think it would just be like maybe a few fairy lights pictures this is my masterpiece like you guys : isn't this just my masterpiece how long have I spent on this room honestly I came up with the ideas babe this is my dream room I literally just can't explain how in love with this room I am even though it's not even done like it's not even done we've probably got I would say about 60% of it done there's still a lot more that I want to do so you walk in there's Conor's desk his gaming setup that's gonna be where he's doing all his work trying to get some shelves to put up on the wall around that then we've got this beautiful rug which is from HomeSense it was so

drawer my ring light then this other beautiful mirror which is obviously fulllength so story about this mirror I have got a DIY video coming soon literally as in like later on this week I think Tamara was in the range and as you can see it's obviously quite big there was one right next to it which was a champagne color this was 70 pounds and it was white originally and those champagne anyone next to it was pounds it was obviously a better color it was also smaller Oh my issue was do I go with the bigger mirror which is the colour I don't like and pay less or white buy the other mirror which her obviously didn't end up buying it was Paul more expensive and it was smaller so I decided to do a DIY job on this and I spraypainted this like a beautiful metallic silvery kind of colour you guys can see that I hang some fairy lights up on it and it's literally amazing got a little hook there as well and then I'm gonna hang that painting up on that or maybe some other paintings I'm not sure

ungodly hour I had to get up super early to a cleaners in to are LSAT so um I'm time I think it's safe to say it's going to be a bit of a long day I'm home just some breakfast to basically have some raspberries and some yogurt and some pumpkin seeds and a little bit oh my god actually able to show you this a bit of this which and I saw recently I saw on Twitter I think tips are not like tweeted that they were bringing this out it's the custom not limited edition chocolate case not his a nut butter oh my god it's fuckin tightens the way for anyone to get me to buy something in this limited edition I'll buy like five or four thoughtful as a whole like in this cupboard down here and there's just like a pimpin up section but so you know me it's so good with raspberries so ya have my breakfast been feeling was a little human that we trying to open my dishwasher is released it yeah and now I'm about to go and do my makeup because I need to go out this afternoon and Lois is going to come and babysit nyla basically whilst I am out and just wait for loads of different deliveries because we've got so much stuff coming so much you getting my makeup cool yeah so makeup time well I have to do my makeup is a Beauty Blender so we're going to see how this goes I think I should be able to get yeah do a whole face without any brushes I mean I mainly wear cream stuff so actually it's going to work okay I think it's only the point where I get to bronze huh where am these get bit weird cuz I know it's going to start by neutralizing my dark so cool success I tried at the moment yesterday I just didn't feel like myself all day because they're just it just in such a strange day also at the moment I should probably shouldn't be doing my makeup today my eyes are so sore I think I got like one of my eyelash extensions has like fallen out and it really irritated my eye in the night I woke up this morning but I was just streaming I got eyelash extensions because I wanted to see if they were lifechanging like some of my friends say and I just wanted to try them out like IGBT reviews like you've got to try these things right but I didn't I didn't love having them I think maybe a lip tint in my lashes would be better really nice I've gone back to the NARS pure radiant into moisturizer which some of you will remember I used like three years ago basically loads of my makeup preferences I've just gone back to things that I used to love all in all I think yesterday was really really fun stressful we had so much help it was honestly like it's still moving a still a bit stressful not stressful more like you're just very active so it's a bit like it you out but actually on the whole it wasn't really stressful at all there's actually a really lovely day like I really enjoyed yesterday has such a nice time everything from start to finish even like hanging out with movers they were so nice and we use the company called smooth movers and they are like the nicest team just if anyone embrace you never needs a moving company they packed for us as well and I just I have so much love for them the guides are so nice like they brought us chairs to sit on they brought our dining chairs out because I was sitting in the street on the curb eating a panini because they had nowhere to sit and then yeah we didn't even need to like supervise iminium we were there because we're control freaks that we didn't even need to be that they were really nice and they bought us chests so on and they just let the nicest guys so sweet yeah big thank you to them because they made my day so much easier and a big thank you to Alex and Darren who were brick in angel those two are ridiculous like alex has a love of flat packing so we kind of know you heart be why she was so eager to come help because she just lives for that though there was just so so nice of President to come and help me help it's so much stuff like it's helped fit the bed together Alex like Darren did bit to my office whilst we were the other flat and just the best like so so grateful for everyone that helped yeah thank you to everyone that helped ok bronze over the Beautyblender is interesting not bad I think you blender doesn't look as clean as it did when I first started I need to get rest now and I'm wearing I'm actually dressed but it's got really really windy and this morning while I was beautiful but yeah got like 2 o'clock and suddenly it's taking a turn it very windy and cloudy so like not so cold but like breezy this MIDI dress is not going to not gonna work out with it you've got makeup all over the dress just like okay so ignore all the mess that this is the outfit I've gone full and just because this is easy to throw like a jacket over the top of I'm actually change these though for I think in my head I was going to work a lot so I might change this but this is nice and casual and I can throw like a jumper over this this is my a sauce Farley jeans and then this is an Asus body which I think I need to adjust a little bit because it's looking a bit askew and but yeah that's kind of the main bulk and then I'll throw like cardigans over the top I've got I think on which I love so probably throw that on and this is what I was wearing no you're kind of I had that all laid out to film and she just fat my job she loves anything that smells like need butter and so this dress is from next put buttons all the way down and then you have a little like split here I picked this up the other day when I was in next on one fire furniture shots I actually ended up picking up the wrong size though but this actually fits fine I would say this is probably really oversized if this label is correct because I'm sure it was on a ten hanger and I got so six and it fits perfectly so I would say size down with this because well try it on because maybe the labels were on potaters probably runs a little bit oversized but this is like perfect for me and I love it so I'm going to pop this back in my wardrobe and I'll wear it tomorrow wrong one they sent me a green one and not a gold one it's a mirror some of its not no but feel fine because they're going to take it weighs more and redeliver it the sender to be great I also like this arrived so well I'm wrap it hopefully this will be the correct thing this I've been sent the correct I said Oh reckon son Hey oh so annoying it's actually like cracked on the bottom why why like we have not had we have one delivery that's gone right so far like here it's like floppy wonder if I can fix it oh so annoying see how other items is in one piece if it isn't there's something really wrong with my karma alright take a little walk into town so let's do some songs quickly because I've got one empty concert it's very annoying making back I look very shiny and all that and I bought quite a few things so I thought I would show you and got another over here and notice here if you hear any giggling yeah I actually had quite productive shopping trip at first the lovely lady who works in spied upon wasn't there and I was like this is not my day what am I going to do I don't know what are we going to do and then I went to another shop which sells her plants to have a perfect plant I'll show you look at that so happy it fits perfectly in my plaintiff is it a tape measurer in there and everything I was like measuring flowers like this which is watching me I go and I'm not finish the same shot it's a shop called unlimited make a really nice stuff like these like marble and gold like slab and they're kind

whole family are helping me today which I really really appreciate so we are just gonna head off I guess I mean I'm really excited just because I feel like this is gonna feel like actually coming together because like I'm gonna have like a table and chairs and I can't believe it so yeah let's go so since you guys have been here I've had it with painted because it was young I wasn't mom yeah well apparently the color was almond white but it was yellow so we made some changes it's just white now although it's not bright white is this just it's like a steering light it's like that it's a flat matte white so it's a different point to the skirting board so it wasn't just flat so we have some dimension but yeah so that is the change over this map we're in this jonatha which is from the 14 I've got this Urban Outfitters just like sure some just night leggings and then my fears and where you're going to set the kitchen came up and oh hey put plates away and stuff this what's going down today would anyone like to cook a tip off me sad a good Jewish milk in Milan so I have a few more pieces that I got since I last saw you so this is one this is from Ikea it's just a lampshade and

chair so this is super cute this is from a furniture place in Rushton I will link the place down here they have like a Facebook page with the pictures and stuff but this was 99 pounds or something like 90 pounds and buy that which is so good for a child like this and only got 240 pounds or something crazy and I just couldn't justify paying that so I got this I'm gonna love it I think it's so cute it's like a mustard color and yeah it just looks really really cute and then this patch of carpet that's like above is going under here and this is where Cody's room is gonna be I know it sounds very excessive but it's gonna look really cute and he's gonna love it he loves hiding under things so it's gonna be great in Cody in their phones just panicked and said Emily make sure they know Cody no I'm taking the door off and then it's just didn't like little under the stairs like a cubby for him but we'd never shut admitting would we so yeah he just crying you'd be so afraid I'd never do that I'll show you it though Wow hey we hope you put the cop in there yeah how's it looking for it yeah and looks lovely perfect much needs you hostage and over Smith yeah we're ready to be official turnover they figure a man talapia what will be calling this it's not gonna be blue but that's the side not bad not bad not bad now it's time to make the chairs they're getting a bit serious and hurry the coach Jamaican we've now got costumes so I got this set of bedside tables from next they kindly gifted them to me back when I lived in the aa flat in London but I wanted to save them put them together for somewhere that was going to be more of like a stable place kind of home so they've been in there packaging for about six months and finally they're getting put together my new next bed which is exact the same the other one but I did have is on the way to match these gorgeous reading tables that they're the Longworth beds are tables they just look like that they're white they're really kind of substantial don't say chunky because they're not chunky but you know their substantial saying that like lovely pieces of furniture so we're going to put these together and then pop these in my bedroom and I can show you my new lampshade that I got as well which is really cool so I made some progress please ignore how team did it is I'm on this big camera being like that but Oh sounds echoing I'm going to show you the bedside tables and my lampshade so this is where the bed's going to go and then I've got my Ottoman I obviously had in London I got this beautiful flooring it's like grey white kind of color and then look at this how gorgeous is that lampshade from Ikea it looks a bit like weird where the joy bears don't if you can see need to sort that out but it was like if he might certify him like pounds which is so good for like eating and then let me see the cute I know everything in here right but I'm gonna be reading coloring with like my bedsheets and there's gonna be something there as well so yeah and this is another like that my god and then the light is like one of those it doesn't really make the real any brighter and then this is the other like this and this is in my lounge and it's similar to one in my bedroom and same kind of style but a different print will you do you just chillin in the mirror looking at yourself you've been done since it'll make seven yeah I'm lipsyncing do you love Little Mix yeah yeah they're cool right who's your fav who let me guess Perry and Jade so this is a kitchen update that's just their kind of for now this is the table with the chairs but I don't know kind of what chairs to go for so ideas wrote for these because they're cute and they're pink but I kind of like I wanted these like fabric chairs but they just don't spread to these like but will they like 30 pounds each not even that maybe so I mean I think something like that really wellpriced a chair and I kinda just have to be sensible because I can't get all the gorgeous expensive things yeah I still think these are amazing though but that's why if you think they look a bit kind of I don't know not they're not luxurious I like they're like they're fun and functional I really like the tables this is where like we're going to be working from so that's important yeah I just still I'm so in love with this chair so mum has just kindly washed up all my plates and bowls for me that I just bought but you may notice that they're white as everything else in this house is like I literally just said I'm trying to go like white is like a basic color that I'm making everything else bright with like everything else I was gonna go with some really like funky fun plates and then I was just like well they don't match and I've kind of got a bit of a situation so we're just going with plain things which is pine I have really fun monks so I mean yeah everything I have some fun like table mats and things like that so like I have like white plates just to kind of match so it goes because I don't like mismatching so but not everything's gonna be white I promise just the basics of white it kind of makes sense doesn't it yeah yeah just the basic so I'm gonna put these away these are just like here we just set 29year pounds I think yeah the set is like six of each little plates big plates and bowls first meal in my new place we've stopped for a Mackey's break I've got my nice little maps out the Disney primal chick bugs that I thought I've lost I had no clue where they were they're in a box of my toiletries um and this is what this is what they're looking like I told you I would do a comparison so I got three of them on you can open one and so this is the original Disney one this cost I don't actually don't know how much this cost me but it was more than the Primark one and then this is the Primark one in comparison so they're a lot smaller and the paintwork isn't as kind of precise but they're still super cute and the eyes is a lot more kind of animated it's a lot more tilt it I don't if you can see that they're completely different like items they're so both so beautiful but both completely different so yeah that's the difference and the chip on the Disney Wonder that much looks like that so yeah that's the difference so there's everything for today's moving vlog I just wanna say huge

I don't want to put things in it and it'll be I'll even just like a little white no no why yeah a little bit this is that this is just common area to a good oil I can do it right now let's do it we

program oof and I have three pots of chesco everyday sweet corn now I don't know about you but I think some people my mistake the fact that I like ping no I don't know no I just think they might assume not even making assumptions but I don't even think I've kind of led them to think like that this is my Lucretia collection all that collected since I was probably bout 15 there's some Starbucks bits in here some made some cash balls but yeah these are my pride and joy that I've collected over about five years and then these are my mugs there is one of me but let's count how many months I

listen I've not been to Sweden in like 100 years I don't know anywhere else so basically we've taken a seat on this bench because we walked around and have no idea where to go to eat I feel like we should have brought a curd person who is from Stockholm cuz I can't all day that I'm from Stockholm anymore we should have googled it before rather than wait but it's exciting it's like we're gonna adventure yeah but after this I think we're I don't think after this I think we're going to get something to eat and eat something sweet or just anyway so we need to find somewhere to eat but I don't know also have to consider that she's glutes and in turn you know these special people in this special needs so we are entering rich thick stuff this is basically our Parliament type thing and this is a little bit dark but yeah Stockholm is feel very surrounded by water so it's there's water everywhere play a crooner which is which means the three crowns studying what is the significant of it to

"no_MY BABY"	"good morning everybody happy Monday this week is a very busy week very busy especially in 147 things world so Monday Tuesday Wednesday I am in a recording studio recording the audio book which is really cool so if you if you don't want to read the book and you want to just listen to it you'll be hearing my own voice the thing is bit nervous because I've only been in a recording studio twice before once was for the YouTube boy band thing which is it kind of just a bit of fun so fine the other time was when I did the documentary for BBC and actually is quite hard you have to kind of obviously you're reading and I'm not great at reading I'm really good writing not so good at reading so you have to read but also read in a certain way and you have to really take your time and talk very slowly and clearly about three days to do the entire book and I'm just not sure that's gonna be long enough I can add more days in if I need to but I don't have free time anyway so I'm gonna go to the recording should go now three days straight of doing that and then Thursday is a kind of a book relief day I'm not doing any books up that day Friday and going to the printers to see the book actually get printed which is super exciting so I think rather miss being a daily vlogger it's gonna just kind of be snippets of stuff you know so um yeah let's get book II think three make the most of planet Earth it's only gonna be around from I've done it already thing three make the most of planet Earth it's only going to exist for about billion more years so far so good it's really hard like it takes a lot of mental capacity to stop see when you read out loud you're just breathing out loud when you're reading out loud would like all that emphasis and making like it all comes violet is quite tricky and by having a bit bright a quick break if I've been in there for what like an hour maybe bit longer yeah yeah because every now but you your your brain use up a lot of power it's good it's good I keep there are some lines that you get stuck on that to repeat them and if it's refreshed rating but quite enjoying it it's that's really nice to bring my own book to life because I forgot my mom's red bits today I'm when she reads out loud I might know Matthew voice messed up a bit there interests a bit on like this so the people who are listening to it will actually kind of I guess hear it the way that I heard it my hip and I wrote it well I am utterly exhausted it is now Wednesday evening so yesterday I was in the studio recording lots and lots of the book we didn't get the color we had half a day yesterday because I've got there at 10:00 and then 11:00 I had an hour long interview with Emma Gannon who has a podcaster is also an author and is very very lovely a mood we were recording bonus content so at the end of the audiobook you have that interview too so if we recorded that and then I had to leave at 4:00 rather than six because I had to get to the GQ Awards which were a GQ Men of the euro was which was your last night so I ended up having three hours less that I would have done which is kind of annoying so today I've been in there all day and I was working from 10:00 till 6:00 you can't really do any more than that because your brain just shuts off for the last hour and a half I wasn't doing so well because you're it's so hard to maintain concentration all that time so I started to kind of mess up a bit more you know anyway I have to go back tomorrow afternoon to to finish off so yeah I haven't filmed anything partly because I forgot my camera both yesterday and today because I can say my hate to be everywhere but also it's not really much to show you I've just been sat in that room the entire time sort of talking to a microphone but the people are lovely and it is really cool it is really nicely make my words come to life but it isn't it isn't easy that's for sure good morning everybody so I believe today is Thursday I want to say I'm getting my jazel confused now so I think I've told you already that I'm going back into the recording studio this afternoon but this morning it's a very busy is very busy morning so I'm working with Jaguar Land Rover in a minute when I find her I'm supposed to babe I was so lost right now I'm doing a talk with with Jaguar this morning and they're showing after that I'm doing a thing with Land Rover I'm taking over there and Instagram stories that there's the basically the same company so you know that's why I'm doing it together then I have a meeting and an interview then I go

every time I Do's is like hundreds of comments like tap tap tap yeah if you if you're here thanks thanks for coming thanks for watching just gonna hang out got some time to kill before i go back to brighten and yeah the live show chat you and share why my Christmas present buying has been an absolute disaster cuz I'm looking at it now it's like I still don't find it funny but everyone I'm telling the story to thinks it's funny so I'll give it a couple of minutes and then I'll wait until matt don't tweet me I saw that yeah there's that little laugh um you know wait come more minutes till a few more people have come and then we'll get into my story of why my my present buying has just failed massively will not even fail just I did the most stupid thing in the world um try to start sorry now i'm sitting here like yeah i'm just gonna wait no wait for what i might though you know you guys the ones that here so i should treat you like the kings and just tell you um lie on my bed is aurash jumper by the way kind of kind of cool um so okay christmas is a stir so this year there I was yeah I was like you know what this year I'm gonna do my Christmas shopping early I'm gonna do online i'm gonna be really organized it's going to be awesome yeah so i did two separate shops online ordered like everyone's things every person i can't presents were out of them in two orders yeah it's a live one order it's fine the stuff came this was the order there was less stuff in yeah so only only a few things in there that cameras are cool so this is good i can do my second order so go for the second order and this is where i get everyone elses presents like most of the people i'm getting presents for was in this this batch so do more ordering online it's grey on my ice is soaked I'm so organized i'm just gonna have so much time not gonna be stressed it's gonna be good ordered it all paid for it and then it said it's gonna take a week to come so that's fine you know it gives me then at least two more weeks until Christmas so I go away I think I was in Germany or something I come back and there's a thing for a jewel you know when you miss a parcel when you get those things same at high you miss we missed you we missed you by Robert had one of those so look T I was like oh that must be my Christmas present and then it said you you can track this online so I ok I'll leave it a couple of days maybe they'll attempt to redeliver it they didn't attempt to redeliver it ok so then I was alright check online so login check online and it's like your parcel was delivered at this time on this day so I was like ah so it's so it's in my house in so i must have received it and then next to it there was a thing you could click and it said um click this to show that like your signature like prove that i had physically sign for its eyes are you know I don't really remember this I'll just click it there it was my name my signature the exact date and time I sign for this parcel so that ha that's really weird because I I don't have it my house and don't have these christmas presents in my house don't remember putting the thing don't remember signing something I don't remember anything so i right let me look at my phone on my calendar so for those either just joined if you don't know what's happening i'm halfway through my disastrous Christmas present story okay so cut a long story short I'm in the process of buying Christmas presents online okay right so I'm in the hairdresser yeah and I was like wow this is weird actually before i look at my phone i cooled them so I cool dat hours like both took like 15 minutes get through and I was like hey I've got this weird query apparently a parcel was delivered but I don't have the parcel but i don't have the package in my house so they were like okay let's just a few check so they checked everything with me like right we're just going to contact the driver so they contact the driver and i'm on hold for like ten minutes they come back and they were like by the way do you have blonde hair and I was like yeah and they were like so first I was like okay if they're lying to me like they could have just googled my name and seeing had blonde hair and I was like yeah like do you own this car and I was like yeah this is a bit like stalkerish now why'd you need to know that and then they go yeah the driver specifically remembers handing you the package and you signing for it on the door so I was like whoa like no way sharp shut up did that happen so that they were like yeah if you know if there's nothing else you can do if you still don't remember we can launch an inquiry into this now as I arcade no we don't need to do because if I've signed for it I looked it was my signature hi old man is just a cute old man walking by looking at me and so that's when I was in hairdressers just got off the phone and I was like a right let me check my phone go on my calendar look at that date that it came they said that exact date and time and try and figure out where I was if i was in etc so look at my phone and it was a day with Matt we were doing more markers filming day and the time they said this river was 530 me and Matt Matt have four o'clock on that day so get home from haircut me of man and I'm like Matt it's really weird do you remember last Thursday were we're filming do you remember a package coming and he was like hmm dono so we SAT there thinking like 530 what we do ah we were filming more markers where I film is right next to the door so we were like mmm do you remember no don't remember anything so like hey that's really weird so I've just kind of apparently sign for this parcel all my Christmas presents don't wear is anyway Matt later is editing one of the videos and he's like oh my God look I can see the parcel so halfway through from a video doorbell goes I stood up walk over get sign for a package get the package and because i was literally in the middle of this video i like sign for it say thank you and then drop it like on the floor just right on the floor now I mean I still don't know if this is what happened but my only logical guess is what is I'm about to tell you next is that I just saw some random comment I was really funny sorry I will talk to you guys in a minute but yeah so looking down and looking back his footage of my like why is so weird like that is my parcel what's happened to it and I think because I was in the middle of filming and I was like so I wasn't in hell just thinking about the video where I put it on the floor is next to where I put all of my recycling and all my cardboard boxes that I need to throw out in the recycling so i think what i did is i put dropped it like next to it or in one of the box and i sometimes have a lot of packages to take out that lock boxes and then the next day I remember taking a load of stuff to the recycling like not like I don't have recycling box I have to walk so you know one of the like big public bins that are in the middle of the road so I remember walking to one of these and throwing a whole load of stuff in there because my recycling all my recycling recycle Kabul boxes and i'm pretty sure what I've actually done is basically throw my Christmas presents away by myself like just thought it was recycling it wasn't thinking and just to throw it away threw it in the bin and it's annoying because I still don't know if that's what I've actually done that's just what I can predict that dies I don't have the stuff like physically don't have the stuff so that was really cool and everyone I've told I called my mom like mom but what do i do dinner what she is laughs literally just laugh she was like ah you prat ah thanks mom thanks a lot um so that was my disaster like f literally other than three presents all of my Christmas presents every single on I spent all that time all that money straight away just threw it away um it's really really pissed me off because especially because I was like yeah I'm so organized i'm doing this so well like so far in advance and then I go and do that so I'm pretty annoying and what's even more annoying yeah as I was like I left it a few days so just so annoyed nose like whoa I can't not but all the people I've got those presents for I can't tell them that saurian just be like sorry I'm you know I haven't got you threw it away you hot not get people present so I was like okay I mean it's really annoying but I'm gonna have to rebuy everything that I ordered so go to try and do that of course everything sold out isn't it every present I got then all sold out now so I had to rethink our eshop everyone's present so yeah that was cool um so that is my disastrous Christmas present I just we can we just forget about it now I told you I've got off my chest I've told you the indepth story um and yeah and now I'm reading your comments so you should lowes you like you idiot like oh you stupid but please feel sorry for me have some sympathy um yeah she's really annoying but hey that's that um I was thinking of making a video on it but I was I just wanted I just had to get off my chest so um yeah how are

thumbnail material doseok both batteries hold your horses item number two we have okay great yep this is still not that fun it's a like a little stand a laptop stand from MacBook remember Age guys showed you those those cables I got for the those long sixfoot cables for charging your iPhone I got three more of those because one is actually broken I plug it in it just doesn't respond it and it's very like sensitive so I've got three more of them I was gonna think I think I've gone with a different brand but then they have such good reviews and the other ones still work completely fine so I was thinking maybe to do what I'd give him one more chance you know the are America's number one USB charging brand after all I feel it when people come around now they're like Jeb go charge on are you up bitch down there look you didn't have to ask me to look just look around and you'll find a charger I nearly forgot I didn't show you what these guys gave me from the office so basically I felt that this whole vlog is just me showing you like things that I've acquired today but anyway I got some green tissue paper which I've always wanted to thank you so much for that and then but no honestly so I'm going to let you into a bit of a secret where's not really a secret I think I've already mentioned this before in a vlog but you recently Wesley recently since I came back from America filming hit the road USA um I have not been I've not been having great I've not been having a great time trying to get to sleep I've had real sleep issues he felt I've never been a deep sleeper ever in my life I've always been that sort of person that if a noise happens or something someone speaks I'll wake up and I'm very I'm very hot which is kind of good when it comes to pranks because it's Catholic never pranked me when I'm asleep because I just don't I'm not a heavy sleeper I don't sleep through much stuff and then since I got back from LA I've just really struggled to stay asleep for a whole night I don't know why I've been going to bed admittedly ever go to bed very very late a little like you've seen them Twitter and stuff we can spend like three or four when I got back and that I thought is jet lag it turns out the jet lag just didn't go it probably has gone but in my mind is telling me that I'm still on different time zone and now I'm back on British times I'm still I just haven't I can't remember the last time I had a night's sleep where I didn't wake up in the night and things I wake up sort of I say at least twice every night throughout the night and the other thing is I've always find it very difficult to actually get sleep in the first place so finally I'm in bed but I'm just sort of lying there thinking about stuff thinking about future projects thinking about future video ideas thinking about like what the hell's in happen to YouTube in the future like I just think about so many different things is and obviously my brain like I'm not gonna lie I'm not I'm quite a magnet of person you know I think about weird things they need to invent something like just plug into my head and project onto a wall what I'm thinking which could be quite scary he could be quite a controversial but at night I would love you to see the amount of things that raced through my head it's a lot like I without a doubt I have sleeping issues and I guess over the last couple of weeks it's really affected me more so so a friend of mine also some of my work with sort of reached out this this this company and asked for like one product but she knew would help get me to sleep I think something wrong your view what you put on your pillow and it is smelly the Roma comes out it makes you feel sleepy and that kind of thing they came back they called this works modern natural beauty they came back and gave me a whole bag full of products to help me sleep at night which i think is so nicer thank you so so much for sending it to me a really is hopefully fingers crossed gonna help me but I'll go through and show you what it is so first of all we have the deep sleep I know with these vlogs it feel more and more like zoella everyday or Zoe sorry then I called as well she's my sister deep sleep a heavenly candle here we have deep sleep bath oil spray on body treatment to relax and hydrate nice and a moisturizer like time open eyes deep sleep breathing relaxing climate sensors for a better night's sleep you basically wipe it over stuff two shower gels we've got the energy bank shower gel so this is the starting a day to get you in the mood you know waking you up and this is one to get you sleepy at night oh my word the sleep plus plus pillow spray i think i'm up using that boy tonight obviously i'm a boy so i don't really expect to be given these hair products as well you don't expect boys to have this kind of stuff but you know we do it helps trust me there's no shame in investing in you know like bath bath oils and that kind of stuff i think it's important i think it's good it hope if it helps you relax you know i think it i think it's good all but before i go to bed there's actually one more thing buddy ollie there's one more thing i actually want to show you that came the other day create your own a flavored lickable blow bubbles using your favorite beverage I am a harmless ain't gonna try that right now let's do it I've just got my first ever cardboard cup ow God you probably can't see that all care but they got me right across where the crease is in my hand that's gonna really hurt tomorrow ludie he'll pour your choice of delicious beverage into the red line do not drink not a food store a cool dry area where you can't eat them I'm confused this does not look great what do we have milk and that's probably not a good choice more milk basically milk we have lemonade or lemonade bubbles would that be quite no would that work can it be fizzy or I don't understand the rules this should be interesting here we go it goes nothing oh and stop to the red line this can't be good this can't be good here oh that looks grim this does not look great there's gonna be a massive fail in it to be one big fail right this is this is making a mess and it wasn't even I don't think I was even cocacola oh hello pop it all over my work top to make it sticky in it oh no it's driven everywhere I can't I can't lick it oh I can't it doesn't taste anything oh this is a good color legit I can't catch it in time come on down come it down here we go oh this is pointless Oh see then they bugger off come back here we go our net pot yes yes yes this is it right it's the moment this the moment no this is now I'm just got sticky face oh my god it's been absolute mess yes got that one she can't taste it ask normally that's going where I ah that hurts more than I thought oh the burp technique do what I'm sticky I've been absolute mess of my kitchen worktop um give me like two three so pack of six like what why would you need that sure what I'm gonna give this I'll give this I'm gonna write this a a one out of ten an actual I've never given a one out of ten for many things just get someone out of ten so there we go that is the end of the

"no_Organising, Packing & Moving  Lily Pebbles Weekly Vlog.txt"	"it's Friday morning and I haven't really had any appropriate time to vlog until now it's been a crazy week I'm kind of all over the place and rich took some days of work so that we could move but it didn't really happen because we haven't internet and we're not really ready to move and but so he's been off work distracting me and I haven't had much work done myself so this morning I'm going to Pilates as I always do on a Friday morning and then we're actually going to scatter Dixie's ashes which is sad but it'll be nice we'll do it together and then I have a meeting and I think this afternoon we'll try and do flat stuff with rich although I need to film as well I'm going to try to fit in a lot today and I'll just bring you guys for long in case you find it interesting hey Pilates was very hard this week but we're going to go down and say goodbye to Dick's in them we just went to a park to kind of scatter her ashes and the kids are there no going by Dixie pretty sad I have to do some work now I'm going to film a video for my meeting a half the kids are running around the house like crazy people and there's some kind of lawn mower growing outside so it's not the best time for filming but I have like an hour window I have to do it I'm actually gonna be filming a home hall and this should already be up so I will link to it below the stuff that I'm hauling and my camera lights I'm just going to sit here in front of this and do my thing yeah filmed all the closeups and I've got to go edit now before rich gets back I feel like this blog is really boring so far but this afternoon I think we need to go to Ikea and do some flat stuff so hopefully they'll be a little bit more interesting then I'm with rich now and we're going to go to HomeSense IKEA lap know them somewhere else Lakeland Lakeland great Friday afternoon I'm asked for my video and edit though it hasn't been uploaded but I can do more work I ever you're going to be surprised at how cheap everything is we're going to look at some mirrors because they're really cheap there it's been about seven minutes and which is already annoyed with me what do you think home sent so far it's full of bars is free stuff like that what we can do that right oK we've got wine glasses any four so we can't have more than two friends coming over Jamie Oliver cutlery set but that was like twenty grit alright Lee Hom sets get home zones get the deliveries on a Wednesday so first time two covers like Wednesday or Thursday now on to ikea ikea used to be fun to visit when i was a kid but these days I kind of dread in especially the marketplace I find it really overwhelming but I have made a list on my phone so hopefully I'll help basically get like make my kitchen beds and stuff I don't think we're getting any furniture today or popping legs my desk because one of the legs was broken just annoying okay now that mean rich madeup you may have had a bit of an Ikea argument we're now discussing glasses and I'm not a massive fan of these type of glasses I don't know why maybe they just mind me of uni but rich likes them too they're big I don't know we're on the hunt for some good glasses I can does like beauty storage stuff now for your bathroom my all the acrylic stuff I didn't know that clever so we've been looking for a chest of drawers so lot probably with the space that we have is 83 centimeters which is nothing I know there you have to have special casing a friend let's charge it these are cool so you charge your phone and the lampshade and one of those nè this makes me happy 82 centimeters so it's really fun parts by Chester drawers I found a few that we like but they're like 600 pounds and then we saw this one and it's 79 and we're kind of tempted even though it's really Afghan it looks really I don't know boring I'm sure you this is it and I'm not sure definitely not the style I was hoping for but I'm kind of bored of looking for a chest of drawers now and I feel like we should just go for it you just come to get the legs for my desk that were broken thing with like here is if something's broken or you decide you don't like it although they do 365 days return you can return it for 3 under 6 5 days no one really does because the returns room has we discovered it was like an hour maybe more weight and it was very boring so we're just we got another set of legs with only like 5 pounds look at rich big kid I kept living at this chest of drawers they're really not that nice but I just want some ways with my clothes really I feel like if there's one thing I don't mind not looking pretty the the chest of drawers wait that montage may look like we just walked out the shop with all the things we did pay in between a film like that okay while rich loads of car show you what we bought we bought a bin for the bathroom I bought these like shoe cases because we've got storage under our beds I thought was a good way to separate our shoes black and I got white I got lots of these like a bottle and lots of these jars I like to store pasta and stuff in them so I've got all different size jars I got some of their glass Tupperware which I really like his them he's very heavy and impractical it's not good for like taking food out the house but for storing it in the fridge like any leftover food these are really nice the glass ones got big wood and chopping board plastic chopping boards legs from my desk and this big bowl to be nice like serving salads then that's the ugly chest of drawers sorry if anyone has those goals and I'm calling them ugly they're not really ugly it is not exactly what we wanted oh I just thought of a genius idea a nice alone choc paints will literally paint on anything you don't need to prime the wood or anything like that I'm going to use one of those chalk paints to play the drawers maybe like a nice gray you just come into the flat and while rich is unloading the car I just thought I'd try to cut the reefing that we bought from Ikea and it doesn't fit guarantee he's going to be very pissed off for Papa even though it was expensive it's very typical me not to measure Oh lots of these kind of jars in Ikea so I'm just putting some of the shelves on here because I don't know till we have food there's not much point I'm just kind of putting them all together and throwing away the rubbish so we saw lots of beautiful toasters some were copper some were beautiful and one had a bagel button which was exciting but in the end we decided to go for a cheap toaster quid kenwood good on Amazon it's black it's fine it does the job I feel like at the beginning I was really into buying everything like beautiful and then I realized I actually really want to get a nice sofa I wanna get a nice bed and I just don't think I want to invest in a toaster we don't even really eat that much so I think this is a pretty good find forty quid online we've got this set last time we're in Costco and go around email is Royal Doulton it comes with mugs small balls small plates and large place it was really cheap 16 piece probably could've done with more than you like four of each they're ready nice look plates very simple they actually also came in a nice light powdery blue so I might get that as well so that we can have eight like four of the white four of the blue it's about half seven and I think my parents are they going to pick up Indian takeaway and bring it here so we can eat that together and then I have to go home and do work because I haven't scheduled anything for this weekend my work timings are like all over the place the moment but if I don't mind late night working I'm just kind of emptying out all the crockery that was pulled and cutlery and I'm gonna give them like a wash so that we can use them tonight we had yummy Indian meal with my parents got quite a bit of stuff from the flat rich did the desk which I'll show you next time I'm there just kind of sort some stuff out there's not much storage in the flat so finding where I think the Hoover's are going to go quite hard but I'm going to head home now I need to do some work tonight and it's 10 plus 9 but I've gotta do some work and I'll blog again another day this weekend good morning everyone today is Sunday and it's getting to the point now with our new place that we soon as we have internet we can kind of move in but then we both realize that we haven't even started kind of packing up our stuff here and for me personally I've lived in this house my entire life for 27 years so I feel like it's going to take quite a long time to pack up it's not like I've moved to rented accommodation I've got like a small amount of stuff and I need to move that it's like a lifetime worth of stuff so today is the day where we're going to stay in hopefully we can resist going out it's a nice sunny day and it's Sunday and I'm gonna get massive FOMO and all my family go and do something fun but we really need to start packing up our stuff so don't really know it start I think I'm gonna start with makeup because that's probably the most stuff I have I'm gonna use at Anna's sandwich bag tip and just kind of organize and get rid of stuff as I go I really don't know how interesting this is for a vlog but this is the only day I can film I'm just not really doing interesting stuff at the moment so I hope you guys enjoy this kind of packing vlog yeah the first room to tackle is my office which is such a mess as products everywhere and stuff everywhere so rich is going to help me go through all of my stuff I have to keep safe stuff like in my office it's just a huge white bit of card I used for taking photos on very annoying to store this is stuff I've thrown away so far and I'm just kind of tidying up or clearing out this section so when we pack we can just pack this is actually the painting that we bought in South France for a flat can't wait to put that up rich has left me to go to Ikea but I just don't feel like it can do this by myself I know I'm gonna get distracted I've been meeting that tidying Brook and she says you shouldn't watch TV or videos whilst doing it but I'm so bored so they've gotten some music but I just get to the point sometimes webs bored I stop so I need to keep going okay now I'm going to tackle this beast of a draw which is full of stationary and round and why is that I don't really know what a for now like your sketchbooks like this that I often use these backgrounds for blog photos these are like old lipstick swatches this is when I did like a mascara blog post that's a load of mascara and blue tuck a blog is best friend advised clear this one out says just thank you cards playing card hole puncher and checkbook right next one look at this old school canon camera this was probably my first ever camera screen so smooth I didn't vlog using this one this was just for taking photos have external hard drive that says dead from guessing means I broke this one so I'm not sure why I thought I needed to keep it but this will be going in the bin these are my business cards once upon a time thought that was very cool indeed now I dunno I actually never really hand out business cards these days but yeah these were I went through many different designs you know this is a fun drawer this is every magazine and newspaper that I've ever had a feature in I probably shouldn't keep the whole magazines and just the pages I'm on top finis on I was on the front cover of one of this love that and all of these are somewhere inside there is a little little pebbles feature and I collect every single one unless they're a board and I can't get hold of them so I don't know what to do whether to just tear out the page and put in a folder for like that's the probably the organized thing to do if I might do that is what I'm going to do is I'm going to rip out the page see this is the one that I'm in beauty blogger extraordinaire lily pebbles and then I'm going to take note of which magazine it was in and the eight and I'm just going to write on top because I know when I'm an old granny I want to say that the Christmas edition from 2014 I have no this is the best one when I was the whole entire last page of lick magazine it was like an interview I love this the double page spread that I had in shout magazine on how to how to be a vlogger I don't think I chose that title but I hear I gave some tips and tricks there's Mia Nana okay I'm done leads student magazine JC BCU magazine shout shout shout shout shout a very enter youtubers shout ASOS magazine Grazia you magazine Look magazine Look magazine this is the worst drawer this is how some reside size to organize all my receipts once upon a time and so they're all in separate month I don't even know we meant to do with old receipts well how is there another drawer of wires and like random instruction books that don't even know what they're for you know these little things you use to kind of get a SIM card out your phone everyone always needs them but you don't need them all the time when you need it it's really a nine you can't find it so the genius idea to keep it in my phone case I'm a well that's my stomach one link near that need to eat something there you go now it's in my phone case okay time for a food break before I try and tackle my desk so I'm going to try and tackle my desk now this is my collection of candles so far I haven't even done my bed every day's gonna say I love these like food paper clips that like giant paper clips I use these to keep all my press releases together here this room is pretty much done that stuff can all wait for me move there's really not much in there anymore my desk is kind of clearish and two and a half bin bags worth of stuff I think now maybe one's my bedroom which is definitely gonna be the hardest okay operation bedside table I'm just clearing out my IKEA Alex drawers and I found it like box of random things and look this was my rounders badge when I was on the roundest team at school bloody loved rounders look at this iPod now that is old school I feel like I need to keep that just for the memories right now I'm going to try and tackle my makeup drawers I put all of these oh and there's such a mess I'm gonna clear through them and then I'm gonna put in a sandwich bag so they're kind of ready for the move just trying on my Max Factor white lab coat that I got given with my name on it I notice I don't get rid of but then really I'm never ever gonna wear that it must be a sign it will be a need for it actually kind of fits me those are this lipstick which is a rocker Lily zOMG this is the lipstick that Zoe London made and this is actually at this event for this lipstick where me and Anna met for the very first time rich is sorting out my makeup bags and I think this might be a slight problem so clear makeup medium sized bag clutch bags okay we got this giant sandwich bags from Ikea and so I'm gonna be putting on my makeup and see I just don't need four of the same type of brushes I feel like I need to pick one and then give the others to friends so I'm trying to do these are my blushes OOP so I'm trying to good look how many tart blushes I've seen to collect it they'd even sell them in the UK I've got five oh this is my fake mulberry Alexa that I used to wear when I was younger hold it up to the camera Rudy we can get rid of these are the brushes I'm keeping which is not that bad considering there were that loads before I was good to keep some stuff for like blog posts and videos that is all I'm left with makeup otherwise I think it's very this was my favorite ever cream highlight to the Gemma kid makeup school this Brad doesn't exist anymore it's the chewy glow all over radiant screen and rose gold oh I loved the staff I think I was kind of like saving it because I knew it discontinued but it's it must be so gross it's like you three years old from the chuckit buy my favorite highlighter ever these are the three lipsticks I made with Max Factor they called PP sunset one more slice and raspberry filled I'll probably keep these just because the memory I'm struggling with the tinted moisturizers because I seem to want to keep them all I didn't realize that I had a thing for tinted moisturizers but I don't really want to get rid of any of them why do we have so many plug adapters the fact that also Ana will find is funny because every time I go away I forget to bring a plug adapter look how many I have this is ridiculous this is mine and Rich's dissertation we had a group there's six of us look how fat that is I mean we should keep it but we're never gonna read it you know what enough perfumes my friends are gonna have a very fun day tomorrow I've got to to teak perfumes are both my favorite philosophers and longboard Amla I don't have to say that they both have like a tiny bit left in them which is annoying I'm just gonna try and use them up over the next week or so look how cool this jo Malone perfume is we'd like the paint spilling down the sides I love that okay I've got it down to this and these are like less frequently warm but I still love them like Tom Ford white suede Estee Lauder bronze goddess stellar summer one Chanel number five and the marykate Ashley one and then these all my like very regularly worn pretty much just jo Malone and like the fresh fig and de teak I love sunglasses they're one of my favorite things to collect a few of them have been gifts and very lucky I didn't buy these Burberry ones but I will give you a little fashion show nerville my sunglasses raybans raybans more raybans extremely glamorous Burberry sunglasses they don't really suit me but I'm definitely keeping them crazy wild Fox glasses more from wild Fox these from deal needs are also from deal I'm definitely on a sunglasses ban I would be buying anymore for quite a while these are all my LAN yards from like every event and thing that I've done even before logging days when I volunteered at Fashion Week I'm going to go through all of these I don't really know what to do with them I don't think we're going to keep them I could kind of cut them out put them into a merit memory book if I really wanted to I'm going to see how interesting they are I decided to chuck them so before I do I'll quickly show you and show myself when I watch this vlog back when I'm old and gray Temperley backstage autumn winter 2013 a fashion week when I still had the blog name what I heart today the DAX show Easter London I'm at 2013 fell to fell oh it's a tube in Milan backstage pass L'Oreal Marius Schwab so this was when I spoke at advertising week I think that was just for another show at Fashion Week summer in CC oh they spelt my name wrong that it just doesn't look right it just doesn't look right Harry Potter want to bother Studios featured creator at VidCon YouTube guess that was at Google and I think I was doing talk and YouTube content creator Google at Manchester me and Anna did a talk at Google in Manchester and then Wimbledon at the Evian sweet memories and MTV Isle of Malta forgot that one how can I have so many sharpeners there's like picking children I don't know it sounds like sheep we're having a bit of a sushi break been a bit tired and faint now so it's been quite tiring doing all that tidying and so that we have wrapping it up have no sushi and then we're going to go to the flat so it's not some other stuff okay so we're on our way to town with all the bin bags in the back there's like a few things just been that's not no use to anyone and then it's a charity bags and I've got loads of at home for my sister's to rummage through as well okay we're gonna go have a look at West Elm now for some light furnishings and then I don't know what you do after that geez oh yeah we both need a juice we're very low on energy show you quickly what we're getting getting a couple of these mugs that were in sale they're really nice I'm going to get this orange throw because everything in our lounge is gray so I thought a bit color and these are the perfect size glasses that couldn't find any ideas you sorta found some here and we're just trying to find out how much these bowls are in sale small medium large at the dump which is just such a weird place you like turn up and you get your little parking spot and then you throw your rubbish away but it's like such an organized way to throw rubbish away I always think it's very strange if one's here they will throw in their rubbish away as well don't throw the painting away or the new West Elm stuffs ah completely forgot I was vlogging and my friend Hannah came around and I would have shown her if I'd remembered by completely forgot anyway we put the throw that we bought on little armchair and that was really nice and I knew that the big bowl where is it I knew that wouldn't fit in any of our cupboard so I'm going to give the larger to my mom and we put the medium ones medium and the small one in there and riches are putting up a nail so that we can hang our painting and then we bought in the South of France I love this just like a girl it's see it's very relaxing it's going to go right there we looked like those people that have like a painting that we bought in France our flat oh no I actually love this faux done rich back of the gross damp made it just in time they should close in five minutes I think I'm going to end the vlog here because there's nothing really left to do today I'm going to go home and I'm going to have some sausages and then I'm gonna wash my hair because it's really worse but we've had quite productive day actually I'm happy and they're flat just feels so homey I can't wait to get in their way to the Internet and then we'll be in straightaway so I hope you guys liked this vlog paper wasn't boring for you and thanks by the way to everyone

"no_PICKING UP CHOCO"	"you know what today is going to be a great day I mean honestly every day is a great day if you have the right attitude the positivity the mentality every day can be absolutely awesome but the reason why today is especially awesome for me is because I get to pick up Choga the Chocobo from the airport literally two trips the airport in one week now when it picked up Rob like what six days ago now going back to the airport Joko is actually flying in for two weeks to stay with me into Texas from August was today August 12th and actually at my computer right now August 12 I think until the 25th so basically two weeks up until PAX Prime in August which I am going to by the way for any of you guys out there who are wondering and I will be doing meetups and other cool stuff like that whenever I get there I'm excited to see choko have not seen him since the last Pat not last packs for the packs before last pack so packs out the first ever packs in San Antonio Texas I went to with choko and mr. wuffles and it was a ton of fun and haven't seen him since then so it's been like what seven months and before that the last time I saw him was actually a year ago today the a year ago today actually marks okay not exactly air to go today but like a little bit more than a year ago today but I met him for the first time and kinney in person I picked them up from the Vancouver Airport actually gonna blog about that link down below in the description of my first time ever meeting these guys it was awesome actually no joke Oh longer than mr. wuffles a little bit of trivia right there for you guys if you didn't know and another cool thing is I got a new microphone that just came in that I'm gonna be testing out it's I think it's called the at2020 plus so right now as you guys know I've got Rob over and now I'm gonna have joke over so we have three youtubers in one condo that has like you know it's got two bedrooms and living room right but one bedroom is converted into an office which is my office so you got my bedroom and that you've got the like secondary office PC set up now in the living room and it actually works pretty well but I had to order another microphone because Rob forgot to bring his I guarantee you Cho couldn't bring it so right now I am the only youtuber with the microphone and I want to open this up and show you guys because heck why not I've got it I'm using the wrong side of the key let's cut this bad boy open see what we got inside oh actually I've never like open up a box on camera before I'm feeling you know what kind of nervous this is this is nervous I'm losing my camera opening Virginie also you guys could see him rocking the mister we'll see sure right now actually really like this tshirt really comfortable oh so this is it the 18 2020 USB microphone I don't know if it's showing backwards I don't think it is though but yeah this is the at2020 plus and I actually bought a one guard pop filter for this and I don't have a pop filter on me but basically whenever you say anything that starts with a P like Preston or poofles or like anything like that it kind of has this pop sound and the pop filter is like meant to block those like weird pops from your peas and stuff like that and so it goes kind of like right around here on this little area right here and then I've also got a my mount for it I don't know what a mite is but the mount is not inside of here actually if I take the camera off and show you guys what it looks like if I could finally get the camera off camera where are you located there it is okay found it so this thing right here on the edge on I'll give you guys a bit of a closeup so this thing right here is what the boom arm goes into and the boom arm can be like fully adjustable like all over here really really cool tool to use if you're a youtuber or if you just like recording stuff with like your audio and stuff like that so anyways I'm actually feeling daily for way too long if you guys can see the time right here is focus okay focus you can do it it is come on 2:17 p.m. choko is getting into the airport you're supposed to get it at a.m. Bailey and splats got delayed by like hours which really sucks for choko so he's actually gonna be getting in and 40 minutes and I'm about just that far from the airport so let's go ahead and head out and pick up the chocobo check this out guys it took us longer to find a parking spot at the airport to actually drive to the airport from my house look at this place this is like under the craziest amount of construction I've ever seen the dallasfort Worth Airport under look at this what is this there's so much going on right here and here's how bad the parking is we are on the rooftop right now I've never run level J I don't even know what it is we're like really tall up we can see like the top of the airport towers up here but it's okay the bay is okay she's looking good she's looking fresh we're gonna be alright but now we go find the chocobo dun dun dun dun dun chocobo chocobo joke about has been acquired he's now on the vlog we have to go with that source of light as fast we don't make it to the light before dike tins we're going to die I'm crazy craft because the Mothra all right so Rob and I are gonna do a bit of a challenge we just finished eating lunch with myself Rob and choke oh you are you're gonna be doing the buddy bye challenge but since we've already paid for our meal loser has to give the other person 10,000 experience in factions Rob maybe you should explain what it is oh so pretty much you have to do is you know very lightly toss the ring and just get it on the hook whoever doesn't the least amount of tries wins okay oh oh this could go up to like 30 times by the way oh just one Oh third time's the charm Rob I was scared for your experience today's a good day listen Rob just grinding blazes too I grind them all day pancakes reason why I made the bet is because I saw him grinding blazes and I knew he was good for the XP now let's watch him fail savagery I don't play around man I'm a savage of sandy ravaged it's coming after you oh that's I robbed four ladies and gentlemen I am the winning 10, experience one thing higher up huh okay oh god you're funny know that I'm winning Oh got it again damn hey guys is Cho gonna talk about here and welcome to the end of the vlog we are now all back after the restaurant with some delicious food jokowi tournaments I said I dig your voice I'm like Ursa from The Little Mermaid I'm so sad but true so what'd you think about the new condo do you like do you like the new design I haven't showed it off to the vlog yet it's still secret until it's fully bloom in the trash um look at all this mess and clutter That's not me that was you that was you Joey's army yeah look at like so djoko's got a like he's got an addiction to these frescas also shout out to Red Bull they dropped me off like 200 cans

feel to live in a heart of darkness hello darkness my old friend oh shut the fun ever cross my eyes I'm like your goes breath also hive got the new microphone plugged up also look at this pop filter how cool is this thing this thing is a pop filter for the microphone but it's not like a normal pop filter that's like circular in the way like attaches to the microphone so got the new microphone setup so you guys going to hear that in the newer video it's going to be awesome but that is going to be it for today pick it up joke oh he's actually to be here for two weeks till in August 25th yeah

was like yes this feels so good this week should be a good week interesting things happening this is so flattering I mean last week I'm crying because people saying unkind things about me that I feel myself at this angle what do I bloody expect breaking news a minute ago it was so sunny they had to open all the windows so so warm and then I looked at it from my bed and it's like a freaking storm has arrived upon Northampton is like the apocalypse what look at that no thought to the schoolroom in it I have to put on some wellies I haven't even got any worries I just finished filming I mean oh my god that shit me up bloody house from uni hello actually made it to the school run five minutes to spare why is it always so polite do you don't feeling pretty good about myself I've made it here early mum when school randon go around down blah blah I popped two we chose and then to Liam's work to drop off some goodies for him doing long shit today they're not going to show you this King your father Here I am fingers anyway okay yeah now we're gonna get what time is it's not helpful we're gonna get bath and pee dude early and then do homework and dinner and cozies I want to take a little Instagram of you could see myself killed thank you hey no okey what seen him in ages there's like I don't really like the kitchens anymore Darcy has found a little thingy that I bought last week philia incidentally it's never too early for Christmas pajamas the weather has gone crazy again I know that didn't actually get a shot of it earlier maybe I didn't was insta storing it as well so don't know which one I did or didn't get a shot off and it's gone crazy so we're gonna go downstairs and watch cartoons there we go and Nixon's dinner I bought these really cute mugs a while ago from home sensor absolutely massive like you didn't get a whole fist in there which is how you measure the size of things apparently anyway moving on I put one for me and one for doodles are one for me one for Liam and we're gonna have hot chocolates and such in the autumn but it's what they're really pretty I think they were very much money either they were 399 each gorgeous and come on sit at the table yum yum yum lasagna and salad big news just got a threepound fiberoptic lamp from Primark and I've got a birthing ball for blowing this bad boy I know it's really small so I've bought a bigger one but a pump machine a good job babe oh it's that classic you find out what you've been looking like all day and when you turn on camera um it's girls night so I've got all my candles lit some girls that I know and we've got dorito I'll show you how to show you a nice we've got Doritos and cookie bites Becky made these and dick and kitten somewhere down there there's one something vinegar fish and chips Claire's got beer in a wine glass living life see you tomorrow good morning it's 7:20 and we're all up and ready for the day so with my pregnancy with Darcy I didn't have this so this feels like almost like a shock to the system long story short I won't like waffle on too long I have really intense thoughts about Darcy coming to harm I worry about it constantly and I think it's the worst case scenario which isn't like me because I'm like a fairy best case scenario sooo positive person and and I find myself well I've had some terrible nightmares which is the common symptom of pregnancy to have a really vivid nightmares like oh sorry and then they kept and then I think about them throughout the day and if something really small goes wrong then I fret about it which is so ridiculous like this morning I dropped her off at school and she had to sit on her own for Breakfast Club because there were no other children from her group eating and so I stayed with her until I liked until she'd finished so she was fine but all like now all morning I've been thinking my whole life toxie's alone what she's not alone she's at school she's happy with all her friends got a play date tonight I just fret about youth like I feel paranoid about her safety and then I start to feel paranoid about this baby's safety but it starts off with Darcy I think because I'm already completely bonded with her and all that sort of stuff but it's be exhausting to constantly so I have the horrible thought and then I have to like work myself out of it otherwise I'll wallow in it so yeah that's a funds that I'm hoping it's just a pregnancy thing and I'm not just slowly going and that in what's of have the baby and I'm recovered I'll feel a lot better I'm sorry to keep bringing negative things into the flogs I don't like to do that because I like to keep things really up but oh the cats are escaping from the room that's supposed to live in yeah I don't like to do that but I think that it's important portrayed accurate representation of what life is really like because then you fall into the trap of showcasing this like incredible life and then other people that are going through the same kind of thing as you like me when I watch other people sometimes and I stay here thinking like why is everything okay for them and not for me so yeah I'm trying to be accurate but not like super dramatic and super down yadda yadda anyway now I'm gonna go get my hair done I'm getting my roots done and I think I'm gonna have a toner on to make it a bit pink because I feel like doing something a bit different jazzy myself up but it's self love etc etc I've got to run these cats up because they're about to go and fly a rocket and rock it's not going to be happy about them going you know it's food

they think good fun oh we're in business it's Thursday is it Thursday yes it's Thursday last night was so good I really really enjoyed it I enjoyed a being amongst Paige and Lindsay I enjoyed the audience it was such a good crowd and like such such like smart women basically I really enjoyed it and also how I enjoyed just getting out and about and not kind of slumming around being mum and it was just nice to feel a bit glamorous today I'm feeling a little bit feeling like oh it nervous I suppose nervous anxious something like that I'm having a CBT session with a really lovely woman called Paula from Northampton General Hospital who is the matron there of the like maternity unit I think I had to meet the matron session last month because with Doc I feel like talking about it and briefly after Darcy's birth I didn't feel right and I went to my midwife a few times so she said oh maybe it's postnatal depression I was like I don't think it is I've researched that very heavily I wouldn't have any shame if that's what it was but it didn't feel like that and after some counselling and backandforth thing it was PTSD and the way I dealt with it was probably not the best way I just thought oh how many more children like the thing that cause it was the delivery of Darcy and this Darcy if ever you are watching this when you've grown up it's not you is there were so many things it was such an invasive delivery I had to have a lot of help and they were also having gone back over the notes though it for a meet them a trend a session where you can go back over and have like a debrief of what happened and don't want to say mistakes but there were a lot of things that happened as a consequence of something else I bring something else having and just like a cascade of things that would hope that would not happen again little little things nothing huge little things but it was all those little things added up and I felt very had a text like I didn't feel good about it I had flashbacks I couldn't sleep blah blah blah I didn't talk about at the time I haven't talked about it since because I felt what I won't have any more children don't you deal with it obviously now having another one going into that birthing environment and that postpartum environment is making me feel very negative so I've been like seeking some help with that and I have a lovely midwife lovely midwives Paula who's going to help with some CBT and also I'm going to some hypno birthing as well so yeah I'm glad that the term that these are all positive things but having to like think about all the things that like upset me so much six years ago is quite challenging so feeling it like that that's at three o'clock before then I want to film a Primark haul because I think I might cry during my session so I want to get that done before I look all like see how we go here we go might update you I might not if it doesn't feel like roar and like there then I will but if it does and you understand and as I say it's not like a very exciting day today tomorrow it's though so now I'm just going to go sit in my soft office bobert and do some writing I've just finished filming my haul what I did a Primark undertaking the tripod it's going up Friday Lord yep oh it already be a look at this please that's a thing that I needed in my life isn't it and in like five minutes Paula will be here for CBT and you know it's gonna go I know we're taught is about really feeling quite quite nervous about it guys a momentous occasion has happened and I will show you it first of all you know to the babies they're just lighting a little selection of candles for Paula because I wanted her to think that I'm a sari together woman and I just licked my giant the white company's summer thing and then they went out this is officially over I can't believe it it's about the best handle ever but now I'm gonna go in store this one has also run out this was a little home since you won Joe loves I'm going to go into store and see if they have an autumn one that excites me I think I'm gonna try and get the wax out of this use it as a brush holder because that is really big can someone leave a couple of how is the best way to get some wax out of glass containers please also looking at my slippers is stronger cats Madison so I've just had my lovely session with Paula who is the matron and I was so good I don't know why I was so worried why do you know what I saw but oh so I just feel so I wouldn't say that I feel like yeah I can't wait to give birth gonna be so great but I just don't I don't feel traumatized from the session know which is which is really good and is this something I should make him eat well video might because I want to talk about this in depth but also I'm acutely aware I'm not the expert in this I mean I'm seeking expert help to help myself because I'm so not the expert in this but really we have to do some breathing exercises which sounds really wonky but it was really nice and started to imagine an amazing birth a satisfying birth and I had never considered that such as me existed as a satisfying birth I had hoped for a non traumatic birth which is neutral but a great birth we talked about lots of things that happened with Darcy's delivery and afterwards and yeah really really nice I'm having another session with her in October as well as hypno birthing from the double mama from the positive birth company which will be amazing whose message ever catch me today um yeah I just feel very very nice good morning it's Friday I've got ever coming

"no_PLAYING WITH BOOBS  Lily Pebbles Vlog.txt"	"good morning everyone today this Thursday and it's quite early I woke up at 7 this morning which is quite early for me I've got quite an exciting day today so I thought I would vlog well it's not that much going on but I've got something cool happening this afternoon first I'm heading into town quite early meeting and then this afternoon I've got a photo shoot with copperfield I told you both me and Anna are going to start working with copper steel which is an amazing charity so I'm definitely gonna bring you guys along to that they've told us wear dark trousers so I have to like find my black jeans from winter these are the ones that have like little tassels of Awesome but oh my god they're so tight they're like absolutely suffocating me I haven't won black jeans since the winter they've told us to wear black shoes I don't really have that many black shoes so I'm going to wear these which I think look a little bit weird with the ruffles but it's gonna have to go with it I'm assuming because they told us just to wear black trousers that they're going to give us a tshirt to wear or something but I have no idea I hate not knowing I've just done my makeup I'm hoping it goes with whatever I'm wearing and because I'm up so early I get to walk to the station with rich which would be really nice okay as usual I'm half an hour early to the meeting and I just got a text from the others saying that they're running late so I'm going to pop the corn in the street because I got sent one of the new Estee Lauder Double Wear nude foundations in the wrong shade and they said I can go into the store Carnaby Street and much to the right shade and take one there he's like a really nice like lightweight foundation so I definitely want to find my correct shade you've always only like Spanish that Farsi warm so he may think I'm really dark calcium's so I'm going to head there now she hopes to be open I don't know okay scrap that idea it doesn't open till 10: silly me think it'd be open at 9:00 I'm so annoyed my hair I said so long curly my heads malignant until you dropped out it's pretty much straight now I don't know how anyone gets ready for a shoot and turns ups actually looking good I'm going to go inside meeting now so I'll catch up with you guys when I'm done okay meeting done and now on the tube I mean my hair is looking worse than ever I really hope that the one there with straighteners or something and I'm heading to London Bridge for photoshoot with fulfil we have like 15 minutes we have to be there but I would get really tiny they're gonna be food at both the shoots and I'm going to be like the tannery poseur so coming three on my honor and I got this finger up and fries and go to Mary do some breakfast either so I've seen one of these before but look a genius wet umbrella push down and out fuck that be all right okay oh my god I wanted my hair like a madman broken I just met a lovely viewer and Leon he told me that I kind of set her boyfriends a long story but basically she thinks that he wouldn't have met he hadn't been waiting for me at her shoes for that event ended long story but sure lovely we're now going to meet the team thank you sorry but they're going to give us a little talk and tell us about cup of Fiona beeping to do a photo we're in this studio it's very fancy and dark we just passed one of the rooms and they're definitely recording some kind of like porn audio book it was very funny but we just had a talk from one of the three beds who gave us bit more background on the chassis and about her personal experience I'm going to wait till I get home tell you guys everything you need to know if I despite us what you're a bit confused don't worry when I get home I'm going to properly tell you about everything about the charity and our involvement but we're just getting our hair and makeup done so that we can take some photos and do some filming and is first up in the makeup chair really nooks ropes a meal is really made by biiian yeah it's like a little matte lip balm so you've got the glossy one now she loves there are some cool little tshirts over here I love this boo boo boos before anyone else we're in our boob ninja tshirt ready to take some photos Anna it was right I know wards are perfect right because it I knew we were going to be doing and I believe so I were I would exciting pink I'm pleasantly surprised lovely Banerjee's if you discuss by are we need more than crops and wishes for us to make it through the night to only weather where we are or to make it through the night orders knives all the pride my love you have to roll seven this is the booth balaclava you've never looked better I feel basic mental they're down here all our wounds and so I am back home now after such a fun afternoon with everyone from Copperfield I didn't really know what to expect during that shoot I knew there would be lots of like boobage but I didn't really know what we had to do in basing had suits and photos and we did a little video clip as well for a video they're putting together for like end of August September but we also had a little chat from one of their boo bit the boo bet is someone who is affected by who have been affected by breast cancer in somewhere whether they've had it or they've had a big scare or they've taken my preventative measures from getting breast cancer they've got like a little team of blue bets you like around schools and stuff giving talks so we had one of those first we already knew quite a lot about the charity but we wanted to learn more and Copperfield reached out to me a few months ago I'd heard of the charity I've seen like Carly and a few other people be involved with them I kind of knew what it was about but when they reached out to me they also sent me a documentary to watch the documentary was on itv2 I think quite a few years ago and I'm going to link it down below because it's the most amazing thing I've ever watched and it really explains the whole backstory to the charity so well please don't like fast forward this part of the vlog because it's so important for me to be able to talk to you guys about what I'm getting involved in and why there is absolutely no reason stop watching now I think it's quite ignorant so I closed itself off from it so no matter if you are a boy or you think some reason that this topic won't affect you or doesn't involve you in some way don't be silly please keep watching I'm not going to be too long but I really wanted to talk to you about coppaFeel and everything that they do the charity was founded by a really lovely lady called Chris who is about my age I think maybe copper years older than me I feel like I don't want to tell his story because the documentary tells it so well but in short like massively short she got diagnosed with breast cancer at Stage four it didn't get diagnosed properly and she basically caught it really late Chris was only 23 when she got diagnosed with breast cancer and I think there's a big misconception over age and Oh breast cancer affects women over 15 as we start having that mammograms and staff and it's just not always the case so it's important for the charity and for myself to be educating younger girls as well on checking their boobs like you to start checking from the minute you have boobs really so she's now living with cancer and having treatment she's been having treatment for a long time so I'm going to put a lot of licks down below so you can read up on Christmas story but she started coppaFeel as a way to prevent what happened to her happening to other women and men the idea is to educate people especially young people on how to check your boobs because I think crazily it's just something we don't do and I think it's all about shifting the power and taking responsibility away from doctors to kind of identify it for you it just isn't something it's going to happen you know when you go to doctors you don't show them your boobs so it's about giving you the power to check yourself and look out for anything that's different or changing it's such an amazing charity because it's all about kind of being fun and taking away this taboo or talking about boobs and feeling boobs and the words nipples and things which people tend to get embarrassed about I think I've been I don't know why but I've been quite good over the years at checking my boobs this is like the first time I've ever thought about it but there's definitely been a lot more information I've learned since working with Cox feel or other things to look out for I think you kind of think am I just looking for a lump I think a lot of one of the big problems as well as a lot of people think like oh this doesn't concern me because I don't have breast cancer in my family or I'm a guy or I've got like hardly any boobs anywhere my boobs are small and it's just there's so many like misconceptions even guys can get breast cancers less common I think about men a year get breast cancer so it applies to men as well even though it's less common I asked I like talk on my hands as I'm sorry this is a really stupid question but are you more likely to get breast cancers we've got bigger boobs if there's like more breast tissue there and they're like no actually not you can have really small boobs you can have really big boobs it's all kind of the same risk so this is important for everyone and copperfield are there to teach you how to check your boobs to know what to do is to know when to do and help remind you to do it it can be quite a scary thought having to check because you feel like you're checking something terrible but I feel like if you change your mindset you like checking to see if you've got cancer you're just kind of getting to know your boobs a bit better because the better you know them the easier will be to identify if anything does change it's not just about feeling your boobs for any kind of lumps and bumps it's also about like looking at yourself in the mirror and getting to know what's normal for you if you have one boob bigger than the other if you have inverted nipples if you have really big nipples are really small nipples it doesn't matter it's just what normal to you it's the changes I think that matters and I'm getting involved with charity so I can talk more openly about it it's just not something to be embarrassed about half the population has boobs it's just crazy to think that as humans we can be embarrassed by boobs cockatiel have some great information online on what you're checking for so whether it's lumps or like dimpling or discharge from the nipple there's different things kind of look out for they also kind of show you where to check for it's not just your boobs that kind of goes your breast tissue goes all the way up to here it goes under your arm and they've given me some little stickers I can put in my shower to remind myself to do it because that's where I like to check my boobs when I'm in the shower for some shower gel on it's just kind of easier and slippery you check your boobs whenever you like to check your boobs is I think it's advised to do it like once a month so you can stick these little stickers in your shower they also have a little kind of text reminder you can sign up to which I think is genius I will get my own little codes I can share with you guys at some point online but today I just want to share with you their generic code so if you text boob it to seven zero three zero zero then you'll get a text every month to remind you just check your boobs and I think they're quite funny in a quite witty and it's such an easy way to remember to do it there's just no excuse not to check it takes like five minutes I think the point is also to give you the confidence that if you do see something that's a bit irregular or you're not sure it's a bit different to what you're used to going to your GP have the confidence to know your own body and to know something's wrong and show them and talk to them about your concerns you know your body best and I think that kind of the whole point I'm really excited to be working officially with coppaFeel now I am a digital boob ninja which means that whenever I feel it's appropriate I'm going to be talking to you guys about checking your boobs and hopefully helping them with like events and all different kinds of like kivett II I still work with Lucas feel better and I select the charities go really nicely handinhand both amazing charities I feel so passionate about you guys know I go to get my moles checked regularly I know that it can be scary but once you just get into the rhythm like I go what's the intership I'm old and I'm going to check my boobs once a month it's just something that's part of your routine if you have like any questions or concerns I mean you can leave a comment I'm not sure if I'm the best person to answer them but coppaFeel have so much information on their website speak to your GP just get used to feeling comfortable talking about your boobs you'd have to show them to anyone just show them to yourself okay I feel like I should stop talking about boobs now but I feel so passionate about it I'm really excited to be working with this charity rich is away for a couple of days so I'm home alone which I hate being home alone I was going to invite my friend over tonight to watch loved Island but then I thought I need to get used to being home alone you know I'm growing up maybe Circe can't be scared to be home alone so I bought myself some fresh pasta I'm going to make myself a nice dinner I'm going to watch the love Island it's still only like quarter to four I think I woke up so early this day's just feel so long I've been getting some work done for the past three hours I think I'm actually sitting at my dining table which has been really nice it's just a bit more like light and airy in here sometimes afar my office a bit I don't know I haven't got the best vibe and I'm not really sure why I think it's just because it's like where it is in the flat bit more at the back which is nice and it's hot but I don't know sometimes I'm not feeling it so I just sat at the table done some work and I think I might like prep dinner I'm not sure we'll find that hungry it's just so weird that like rich isn't coming back after like to no one to talk to and you're home alone I mean luckily I'm vlogging because then I'm actually talking but otherwise I'd just be silent with my own thoughts very weird I don't know how to live alone for dinner I am going to make this is actually a recipe which I've put in a video a long time ago which was like the Valentine's threeways it's a really cringe video I got to make fresh tagliatelle from Sainsbury's there's like a local Sainsbury's near me they didn't have much choice really but I thought fresh pasta would be nice and this doesn't make you feel all exploded and then I've got cool jet and parmesan and I've got some chilies as well when I've got garlic here so I'm going to do is grate the courgette and you basically cooked garlic up with the chilli add the grated courgette and then you the end you add grated Parmesan it's just a really nice like a bit of a different sauce because it's mainly courgette there's like 18 with a little bit more healthier lots of veg in there although it is a pasture but looking forward to watching Long Island tonight I can't believe it's nearly over final is on Monday night and me and I are going to be out at press event it's such a disaster I loved it so much I just like I just think it's been so great Sarris any of you that haven't been watching it's

planning the hen party I'm going to take my makeup off and I'm going to head to bed and watch some YouTube videos it's like half 11:00 but I feel quite awake again it's public as rich isn't here I

"no_PRESENTS FROM YOUTUBE"	"Hey hi hello right as my as one of most interesting years were had in my life hello good morning everybody it is a Wednesday Wednesday my favorite day of the week Wednesday um it's really late in the day actually is gone past 12: and I'm still in bed I went to bed last night about 4 a.m. because I was trying to film I went with like a robot I was trying to stock up on lots and lots of gaming videos to put out whilst I'm away in America I want blood there we go and I'm starting a tramp blog although because we're actually our technology now in this new Joan Casper hit the road USA we're allowed to bring our phones of us and like technology so I'm going to try and vlog everyday while some away may be quite hard to actually upload the footage because I can be in like rogue parts of America I've never heard of before but maybe internet is good there who knows but anyway um we knocking on wall um so yeah I'm going to take my camera with me and try and do I can't obviously film what's going on in the film because that's you know that's cheating that's your comment you can't do that but what we'll do is just vlog maybe a little video entry for every day and just keep your data and what we've been up to and that kind of thing and just what it's like and is that these parts these parts of America because I'm going to new parts I've never been to before I just put on a conference call so minute ago that's why you heard that's where you heard that noise that that was it cool when you want to hold the hold music so just had a conference call about a future a future project and with zoella 203 nine point seven nine recurring it's that pie I can't remember so yeah now I feel like I've haven't wasted a but I slept in had a massive line because I've seen went better for so now I must get up I mean most of my day I'm cleaning compact because I'm off to America tomorrow to start filming John Casper hit the Road USA so that's carrot well I might play smile again why why you close your eyes again yeah bed sug now I don't know who's easily left in my fridge but either way I'm gonna eat them I don't care if it's for kids the most childish looking look at petit valu big popped raspberry flavor I don't care I'm gonna eat you I need both of you you're both gone sorry but I'm shower I'm ready I've had my lunch and I've also got my paper so you know what time of day is time once again where I go for the news and try and find some lighthearted funny news stories to cheer you up that is the aim of the game I'm looking for different paper this time they didn't have the one I usually get but I should be fair that's nice to always read so front page okay that's just human glue that's just not fun um nope that's negative negative negative there's no nice news today what is going on in the world drugs pay for a zoo a drug dealer who had a zoo in his back garden has been ordered to pay back fifty five thousand pounds okay well this is des it means it's not really like fine news but it's kind of interesting so basically this guy he was 62 years old in Manchester yeah snakes bearded dragons goat sheep chicken and turkeys hopefully not all in one place because that that's a recipe for disaster other police found drugs including cocaine crack cocaine amphetamine ecstasy and cannabis and thousand pounds in cash he was locked up for three years and now must pay back fifty four thousand pounds well good luck with that may chef Phil thorn has won the world nettle eating championship after devouring 86 feet of stinging nettles in an hour in the bottle in pub in Marsh would in Dorset why would you do that because stinging nettles have acid in them and then dock leaves have alkaline in them and this is the way around no I think's thinking that always have acid in them so when it is found by singing it old that's why it raises your skin because it irritates it from the acid listen to you nettle and that's where you get doc Lisa doc you've had alkaline in the leaves which neutralizes the acid from the stinger nettle and then basically gets rid of the stinging feeling a motorist was find after he was caught reading a novel as drove along the m27 one in Southampton obviously now that's terrible what you should have what you should have done whoever this motorist was was download the book from audible and hey guess what guys you want to sign up to audible then you can now add it I've haven't done that yet and there yet one of Britain's oldest women turned 109 yesterday well was born early night spent the day with a family a care home in new clean korma 109 years old I was thinking about this in a day do you think you think on average that we like our generation are going to live longer in their generation before us let me know the cost below what you think's I don't know I feel like it I feel like we should because we've had such a team Medicare is improving uh I want to like know some science planners if you if you actually have like a good answer to this let me know in the comments below I'd like to hear we have to say about it okay and there we go that is your quick little news blows in today of just fun fun interesting and not negative news of the day I hope you enjoyed it let me know your thoughts and I will potentially carry on tomorrow as you know where I'm getting flight tomorrow maybe I can still do it in the airport somehow hmm also this rod yesterday from YouTube it's a yearbook the gold play button class of right I think this is a new thing this hasn't happened for any my other other two channels that's Joe or that Stroeve vlogs this is quite a new thing this had to happen to youtube so unfortunately I don't have a yearbook for my first two channels but I do have a yearbook now for my gaming channel so here we go you might have seen this on other youtubers channels that hit a million subscribers in the last year this is hello thatcherjoe games you started your adventure in 2013 that's when I made my gaming channel cut member that was the year after that your first video your first video was and so it begins the sims 3 to celebrate your success we rewarded you with a silver play button you created around 163 videos I'll let it's got all my thumbnails on that I'm glad my thumbnails I thought I start using Photoshop for my thumbnails straight away and they're not just ones of like my face tiny top corner and screen on my pen again your viewers come from all over the world the number one viewership is Great Britain then the u.s. and then Australia and over that year I've amassed over 83 million views which is only obviously on even more an hour which is insane that's more than every copy of Minecraft ever sold put together this is so cool thanks Susan PS keep it up we've got a diamond play button with your name on it when you hit Tammy and subscribe our stop it that's not gonna happen maybe not this channel anywhere I don't know so you let these are all the people that hit 1 million subscribers last year now I'm actually very very like worried that you're going to think that I'm an absolute nother for saying this but there's something about the play button that has slightly annoyed me this year it sounds so bad like trust me I appreciate so so much listen right here as you can see this is the 1 million subscribers plaque for facto vlogs my vlogging channel which were watching right now and this is what it looked like it is very heavy very big but on the wall it looks so so badass my million subscriber play button a ride the other day for my gaming channel and look at it is it's Miniver it's a mini version it's got a smaller the actual play buttons got a lot of smaller and the size has got a lot of smaller and obvious a lot lighter and it kind of to be fair it is I think better may like it's better made ler and we try and show you on the back it's got the felt back on it and it's got the two holes to hang up now another one and it's just like a lot more sturdy and easy to easier to move about and actually put places like on a wall and stuff but my original plan was to obviously have to have my original gold play button on my wall and then this one next to it and then this one next to it but now it's gonna look it's gonna look different obviously because this is a lot smaller than the other two so it's not gonna look right so now I'm like what what do I do so often when I have up on my wall in my office although these are bigger and this look more badass this one looks more in proportion if that makes sense the play button is trampled I need to put them all together on my wall and this one is now just a little bit smaller than have to try that I'm not gonna do but we'll think of something but anyway I want to say thank you to youtube for giving them to me and also thanks to you guys watching the videos without you guys watching them you wouldn't be there you wouldn't be there and you wouldn't be there ok so it's some time later now and I think the world's ending can hear that all of a sudden like I hmmm know where I'm filming some gaming videos and all sort of his massive loud rumble of like lightning I look outside it's ok yet thunder and lightning it's been like a really nice evening all of a sudden but it's under comes out of nowhere right above my head and I got outside to get something outside cushions in and stuff off some chairs and there's like sirens and I open this door over here this is massive warm like gust of air comes in it's like it's like really warm air like like probably like fast wind but warm air the only other cup not only with like a a storm is colder I think the world's ending everyone I think this could be it it's giving my last vlog member um to that vlog where I pretend the world had ended and it was like a joke video I think it's actually happening now because now there's like police sirens and everything everywhere it's really odd oh my god it's properly you can you hear that it properly hammering it down and the sky is just like it looks so weird right now absolute nightmare I put a wash on it on today completely forgot about it so now he's obviously dry it I love her just done it and it's the cook time is currently midnight oh dear it's basically all my underwear in as well if the trip so I could be doing the whole of American commando general that is look it up you don't think this is stupid with me this is actually quite a big issue I've lost my jeans that I really want to take with me that they're at their special pair like the ones I want to Coachella really light blue ones I have no teens at that and obviously it's hot out there I need like jeans if anything I mean I should wear shorts like a normal person but I really wear these white like light colored jeans can't find anywhere I look around the whole house run operation run the whole house I can't find them anywhere Joe think if you were a pair of jeans where would you be not in there nope not in there what are you doing down here you need to go in the bin oh boy a some got bin yeah so he's like bin bag for bins this massive mound of clothing doesn't help but I Harbor scent would not friend them away I wouldn't have left him at a friend's house they have to be in here somewhere that's the wrong color jeans but yeah I need an oh what a bloody hell they wonder I've lost them I'm finding random packets of bloody confectionery another light's gone out great chairs made a bloody torch wait oh we found you thank goodness gracious I found you oh I miss you jeans and I hope you're clean yeah oh good quick guys we're good okay this is the the secret to packing within 10 minutes basically you prep it we like before so your tshirts in a pile you get your jackets in a pile your jeans and shorts in a pile your underwear in a pile and your bath rugby shirt in it's pile on his own and then you get a suitcase ready to go in the morning you just get it all together and bung it straight in and zip it up you leave to the last minute because he's time to think about other things you need to put in there so then you've got space put the shoes in there already and that kind of thing but keep it out ready going the more yous buggerall in and they did you time to think about we need to put in there that can be completely wrong but the only thing is this is real talk right now there's actual reason why I'm doing it this paper ones because the clothes I was trying to drive the last half an hour are still soaking wet now fingers crossed this somehow miraculously dries by tonight be fair all this probably will dry by tomorrow sorry anything I'm worried about which is the thing I actually want the most is these shorts because nothing says join Casper hit the road USA like a pair of light blue denim shorts no I mean oh my god you missed it but literally I building I swear huh do you see that wait for it I could be lightning in know thunder you hear it oh

bar we have a little bit of a spanner to throw in the works people don't know because I'm not actually gonna be running it and my excuse so far as I've gotten splints good excuse which is actually true I did have shin splints but I would have manned up through that and carried on training the real reason people don't know why I'm not running my own half mass in which makes me feel really like guilty and craps to be honest but baby you I don't know yet other people running no no yet you will know by this point if you haven't seen my main channel videos we slash mediums in all the hard work here a happy baby and so I'm not running but we go over to film it so he'll be really fun I'm running Mike is running look at this look at mosquitoes you she was fun wear that tshirt can't above a Superman yeah yeah there you go balls and then look at look at the colored accents on the shoes and the short and he's got a gin sling things options matching watch geez I've got car shoes fuck I've still got my tshirt on guys and I'm going to be on my bike cheerleading and what I also haven't told the charity yet or you is that I'm going to matching all of the donations from today so everything's raised so far I'm going to match and they don't know yet so that makes a little bit less bad amount on running it good cuz topsecret right we need to get a car everything everybody how you who is the most ready the doggy knees we got two extra runners treat course going to be running piglets going to be cheerleading and squidgy Roo are you running to we've arrived at the venue guys

gonna pin this going on your back back then you can see me running like I feel super super lame cuz I'm not actually gonna be running with you guys today started off the shin splints then I would have manned up and got through that I'm actually having a baby right guys so I was going to go on my bike but we just found out we can rent a tandem bike James's hurt is back so he's not running either we're going on the tandem bike we're going to catch up the runners I've got my really sexy rucksack here and I'm going to be pumping out some tunes and we're going to try and we're going to try and catch up with them slightly worried about how out of breath I am from cycling around this little field but this is my very technical music station but I think we should have rented these instead hahahaha these would have been awesome so enroute guys and we just saw Mike here oh he didn't even stop we was all so quick and he's way ahead of others but he also him an ally gave us their boobs they're like we can't deal with me so we've now looted God boob I've got moved James I said you're not allowed to because it would need to be in my way let's find the others Mike's been overtaken by a lot of people think now not first he's coming it's almost there despite running to me I can run up meet him guys yeah I don't know the walking wounded we did it guys well I didn't do it but everybody else the run was so fun going on the tandem bike was my highlights be honest everyone is badly injured by the engine I'm I'm not injured limping yeah but I'm just tight everything's tight so basically no no injured my legs sort of held up all right where is it touching well I've had a shower and basically I mean exhaustion all week I didn't fancy having like team boobs oh I'm just throwing it out there I would not found hashtag team boobs but was so fun and everyone that came was so nice I really had a good time amazing job everyone all the money they raised work and everyone got round was amazing yeah everybody was super friendly like yeah it's a really fun day and now I'm from killzone a as well guys you know what army having a little I was just about to say you can still donate if you want to or you can laughter my own about his beer I'm equally uncle oh I'll link to my page because he actually ran me and I died squidge but it will be good to get much good news well as much money yeah quick link to squeegee but yeah when out mom and dad's and we're having a barbecue on the wall tell you something mom's BBQ is pretty small about the size of output we've just got home and I swear guys since I found out that I'm pregnant this one is so clingy with me she literally follows me around everywhere don't you Hey she's so cute she were just sitting over there with my coo on a sidenote is feeling very sorry for himself someone is very injured got the ice on this leg we've been groaning and moaning and I came in she's literally like you're so cute I love you anyway I'm also going to look through the goodie bag for the first time I might do this on the floor actually I'm going to run out of space so everybody on the run got given one of these awesome goodie bags the guys that Eyler sponsored the race so they made us the tshirts and they made us the bags and they also gave us some goodies for the goodie bag so I'm going to show you what's in here some really yummy snacks actually first of all there's one of my brow timers and my Flo loves lashes are like my two favorite products from my I'll arrange all so let's not judge on the nails right now guys it's a bad situation and then the awesome guys from Kiehl's gave us all an ultra facial cream and which is a fullsize one amazing and a mini version of my favorite Sun cream which isn't having to cover up my own face that will focus which is the SPF and love that stuff and then we got a badge I've already got one of those on right now and there's a Copperfield sticker a boob checking info card there's this stuff which isn't so good I've had this before this is a pip and nut coconut almond butter some pop shit some Evian water and then more info from common feel so awesome little goodie bag and I honestly had such a fun day I'm definitely going to have to wash this team boobs thing off at some point but Lissy Lissie actually ended up with a tan line of team boobs which is pretty hilarious she also just texted me saying she thinks she's lost a toenail from the race so I've got so much respect for all the girls that came out today they're so awesome I was so good that I couldn't do it but I had the best time cycling around and cheering for everybody and it was just so fun like I said before there still is time to donate so if you guys want to do that it would mean the absolute world to me and I'm going to match all of the donations up to ten thousand pounds so I'll let you guys know how much we end up raising but please please donate and be really generous because I will match whatever you guys donate so I'm hoping we can get to 20,000 pounds which would be so awesome because coppaFeel is such an amazing charity and yeah they've been so amazing organizing this event and they were awesome when I told them I wanna run and everything that she's been awesome throughout the whole thing so I'm so proud of everybody we actually did it and yeah I hope we can do it again next

"no_SHE GOT MORE PLASTIC SURGERY"	"hi guys I started the blog already and then I was like I really like that clip I'm gonna redo I'm poor trees like yeah you kind of rambled on and I was like babe that's rude don't say that then he's like no it's what you say constructive critique in struct of criticism but you said a different word what was it I combined the two he was like constructive I don't know but it was funny and then yesterday we were talking about something and you meant to say like dramatic change what did you say instead Dramastic you're just not cute because you make up words anyways we're in the car right now I'm going to pick up my sister welcome to today's vlog guys we're up in Salt Lake for the week my mom is getting another surgery she's doing a mommy makeover which means boob job and a tummy tuck she did the boob job back in April I talked about it and so I clogged about it I will link that blog down below I like that vlog I feel like it was cute we just likes and talk and it's a good memory but yeah usually I think usually people do the two surgeries together but basically we were gonna go on this like trip and then it didn't happen so she had like changed her surgery schedule around the trip and then the company we were gonna work with was just like really annoying and it didn't happen till she had already like separated the two surgeries so she did that back in April and announced is it October 1st no oh it's only the 29th of September yeah so she just decided to separate those we're up here for the week just to help her out with like anything she needs help with taking kids places picking up kids from school fuck her picked up tab earlier yes tab always loves it when we come up well he loves when Parker comes up to visit because Parker's cute plays basketball with him my grandma is also staying up here so basically we are just helping my mom out with whatever stuff she needs us to do cooking cleaning kids all that stuff so we're gonna be a hair picking a baby then we're headed to went to the store to Walgreens yeah we wanted to look at that as seen on tv products there we heard there was a good section to shop from there yeah and we're also today we've been filming that scene on TV videos part two yeah so we're doing one on my channel and one on Parker's channel so I filmed all of mine I just barely got done filming pretty much I have like a couple more shots today but I have to do them tomorrow Parker has some products but he doesn't really like love the ones he has just because he thinks ooh they're not that exciting so we're gonna see what else we can find at Walgreens I'm also awake excited to show you guys my outfit of the day because I just got these jeans and they're so freaking cute I'm like obsessed with them and they're from looking Gray's I'm gonna link it down below but when we get back to the house we'll show you a real outfit isn't it hey sister all these kids look so little I know I think that too it's not like remember when you're one of them no like I remember when you were in high school music oh my god everyone looks so old and now I'm like and I'm like wow everyone looks like they're like 12 that's how I felt too though like I remember being a little kid going and watching like like high school or here and being happily cal that guy is massive but they're not met two guys now some of them they're like I looked up to in sports and it's like they're just regular size because they're older true it all makes sense that is some knowledge there's some wisdom right there we're gonna start doing that we'll do a comment of the day and a wisdom of the day here's the question of the day comment of the day what was your favorite year of school like from kindergarten to however old you are or college or whatever like what was your favorite year I'm gonna say mine was junior year every year of high school was the same like they were all equal in hardness to me like academic wise who cares about academics junior year and that's when I got like a solid group of friends like sophomore year I had no friends in the senior year my when I was a junior my friends were seniors so that senior year and they were like gone so I feel like junior year was my favorite even though my mom would see this would be like you know my junior year because it was a really hard to hear cheer for me full of years you know I can't pick a favorite why yeah fucker can't pick a favorite anything I'm like what's your favorite color he's like oh well I had a blast every year even in my elementary school I always had fun dude I always what's been yours so far I don't know cuz I'm like just entering high school and I feel like everyone is like oh high school is the best so like high school is the better no definitely not freshman year but I don't think anyone likes freshman year I don't even remember elementary school how can you know I know like I remember like how far back can you remember I feel like I can't really remember before like fourth grade yeah I was yesterday like of course I can remember like memories from my life or whatever but like school and stuff I can't really remember before fourth grade like I remember my teacher and my friends and whatever but before fourth grade I'm like what I don't know happen to my life fourth grade is the high like the smallest year that I like can remember a lot I like what it was like to be a fourth grade because this whole thing is gonna get cut out yeah but like I was thinking yesterday I do not remember you before high school like I feel like when you were in middle school I like have no memory of you you look extra cute today yeah I'm not wearing makeup and I didn't do my hair it looks good though way cuter than you do yesterday wait you didn't even laugh at my joke I said you look way cuter than you did yesterday oh it's a joke so I was telling you that Parker hates when we Yap because he has to edit I have to add it all to all that this whole conversation again and then probably a couple more times as I'm like going back saying okay why should I bother him all right relief wrap that's not a good one okay so we didn't find any as seen on TV stuffed burgers probably gonna order some on Amazon we found some but it wasn't what Parker wanted but we went to Smiths and des we found some but Parker didn't like it anyways we went to Smith and we found these I think they're vegan it says they're dairyfree where does it say that though I don't know they are a little ice cream bite so I'm gonna taste it two thumbs up crunchy version what's that No okay we're back home so here is my OOTD I literally put this on and so I was like running out the door so I haven't had looked in a mirror so I was hoping it was cute and I think it is I really liked it so I just got these jeans sue just got these they're from Luca and gray they're so cute I love how they're cropped and I'm 5'4 and they're still crapped on me so if you're even taller these will like look way cute on you but I love how they're super distress they're so freakin cute and like obsessed with these I love them and then I think we're sold out of these shoes but we're restocking these ones are actually my mom's so they're a little bit too small for me but I have been wearing these with seriously like every single

reckon ever really tried I do genuinely feel I've been serious that is really soft but I wouldn't pay two pounds from every time there's a video online with the to challenge where you have to guess which I guess much brandalynn coming in shooter yet trailer yeah alright guys I am tucked up in bed my camera battery is gonna do doot doot doot doot so it's going to run at any second I've got a couple of things to clear up with you everyone who's asking yesterday where is Zoey's thing gone are you breaking up because her makeup unit is gone no no she's just moved it upstairs you guys man anything happens with Zoe and I and everyone thinks were broken up she's literally just moved her makeup thing because it's a couple lot of room upstairs I think this camera battery is gonna work but um yeah I would say nope not break it up she literally just moved her makeup unit upstairs don't mean that we're not breaking up that you're just moving your makeup unit upstairs yeah we just thought it looked better with some like a chair there instead or like a summer sport clothes instead of it it mean just make up when she could do that obsessed so that is number one number two I didn't even know about until today tons of you have been asking online recently where Zoe and I are breaking up or not and I just I didn't get why you Alaskan and then mark just asked us something today that like was so obvious and he gave it away he was like everybody thinks online you're breaking up because you're madame tussauds wax figures aren't together anymore so they are what happened is basically because the wax figures have real human hair like it sounds weird but they are that the hair in it is real it's dyed to be the same color as ours but it is real human hair and because tons of you guys go and visit and go and like have pictures with us and my hair and it one day is like this the next day is like this like you guys love to like style our hair for photos and some like the One Direction boys are know how to have like their faces relight touched up all the time because people kissing them leaving makeup marks on them and stuff but anyways it turns out that Zoe's needed its hair washed as you do so she got taken out of madame tussauds attraction how long was it for like three or four days I don't know I think so for something like three or four days her blacks figure got taken away whilst they were washing it hair and and tons of people online love to love to talk about whether that meant that we were broken up because my finger was by itself and Zoe's figure was no longer in the room no the figure is back in the room and we're still together I just thought I'd explained those two things I'm going to get sleep now I've had such a fun day did you actually have a good time rock climbing yeah it was good did you actually enjoy yeah yeah it was good I'm glad you enjoy that a1 absorber climbing for so long as it's my first run with Max and Shawn and then this morning she woke up which is I should go rock climbing tonight I was like of course I'm not for that so we just yeah next next persuasion is poppy everybody tweet poppy telling her that she needs to come rock climbing I think next time I go I want to try and go during the day because although it's it's super busy like not everybody's climbing on the walls and stuff but I just didn't want to vlog there too much because I didn't want to film other people in the background like if I'm talking to the camera you can obviously see behind me and I didn't want to film a little people behind me backs any life somebody doesn't want to be on YouTube and be on the camera and I didn't want to do that to them without asking them but there's so many people there I can't ask everybody so yeah next to my god I might go during the day so it's a bit more quiet so I can vlog properly there I've had a good day tomorrow morning we're gonna going to go get breakfast super early I finally get my sofa being delivered tomorrow to my office that I've been waiting for for eight maybe even nine weeks now I've been waiting for this sofa to arrive and apparently it's arriving at 10 a.m. tomorrow so I'm really

at last week actually which is the Friday so that was pointless better information I'm on my own today I am George went home to Helmsley to his parents house last night and because he just wanted a bit of R&R I couldn't go with him unfortunately because it's my sister's birthday weekend and I wanted to be with them with her she's going to be back to think tonight but possibly tomorrow in time to save actual birthday on Monday but today we're basically me my mom my dad and my sister base are going fancy dress shop fancy dress outfit shop it is basically it's my uncle 60th birthday all the birthdays recently and like the first weekend of May and he's having a 70s kal 70 theme from stress part 20 and we've been put enough shopping for said party for some time now so it's getting a bit close to the wire so we need to get cracking so if we're going to head up to Alex Alex which is incredible like Emporium full of independent boutiques and stalls and shops and things like that that do a lot of fun to dress a lot of vintage and retro items so we're going to hit there if we don't have any look that and we'll probably go to good old love you babes if you for Manchester Oh live in Manchester you will know why won't this ever bloody focus you will know all about loving babes the best fancy dress shop in the world so yeah that's what we're doing today I'm gonna go meet there met for some lunch first up I might need to say I'm absolutely freaking furnished home then we shall see where the day takes us I'll quickly show you my outfit before I head out the door please absolutely beautiful day but I think it's going to be just evenly cold so I've got the old biker jacket on unfortunately I wish I could just let this top do all the talking I'm sorry so we have this beautiful ruffle check shirt this is from a soft and I really love the colors don't think you can I don't know I'm showing you that sorry that you really see how love the new colors are but it's like green and pink and blue and like a darker pink throughout its really bit lovely and then I've contrasted that with my biker jacket but then kept the pastel theme with these jeans a little bit unflattering on the old crotch I mean I look I have got a penis and and a vagina all together so it's good but I don't know I think I like the way the colors work together and then catch with like that punk rock theme with my marsh Lucy jeans are from next and I love this step hem and the contrast of panels again in but I just don't think they were all too flattering on my kind of body shape well we'll roll with it and then I've got my Stella McCartney bag Heather my fellow Bell bag which I've kind of like full and more and more in love with again I kind of neglect it for those like mile away and my Gucci but this is like the biggest bag in my collection and it's really really nice and I won't mind getting some photos on my actual blogging camera of Affleck palace today so I'm going to take that with me in this back and then my rayban round metals in the reflective silver so yeah that's my outfit of the day pretty comfy pretty cool love it show you about my penis vagina hybrid down there but what's not worked well while Joe's is the way yesterday I cleaned the entire flat from top to bottom on a Friday night also welcome well they just breathe in ijen because I've been so busy for the past few weeks the flacc been neglected and George is the same he's so busy so he last thing we both want to do in an eye is to clean the flat and I even toyed with getting a cleaner in and I just sort of thought that I'm going to do it so I spent Friday night doing that and the flight is absolutely beautiful I'm sure I love Alice so much when it's all clean and tidy and so waking up this morning was an absolute joy got a bit of ironing to do there to change the bedroom for George get back and but other than that it's like spickandspan animals wall when I've in which look expensive hamster looking to do which is those : what you do that let me see this helping oh regardless killer good evening everyone it's Saturday and we're going out for and for dinner for sister's birthday I'm not in the best of moods that I must say I'm a bit damn adults with my wardrobe at the minute it took me so long to decide on what to wear today and it seems to be doing like every single day getting dressed it isn't as easy as it is I think it's the change of the season and I feel like a lot of people go through this especially even me so like please know that your favorite fashion bloggers and stylists or whatever they still have those days without no idea what to wear and yeah because it's like all the summery stuff are in the stores but then the weather shit and so don't really know what to buy a minute and it's just getting me down a little bit because that's usually where I'm very comfortable and confident I'm right now not digging it most not really digging my makeup today I'm just in one of those like self not low thing because not loading myself but just not happy chappy and now also missing George and he's just very quiet today because he's just completely relaxing and like napping all day so I miss him because I've spoken to him so yeah just a little bit down in the dumps but today was really nice we didn't get any fancy dress outfits which was a joke and but we had a nice day out all the same and yeah I'll show you my outfit even though ain't that great I have got this epic earrings and got these from H&M and last week retro from a mom or sister and they're so disgusting but so bloody ultimate look they've got a little evil eye on them just beautiful massive heart with like pink and gold okay this is what I'm wearing I've got a velvet should I sell from paramount this SuperDuper old just found these jeans in another package that have an outfit sent me really really like the feel of how they come like the ones they come to on the ankle and these huge rips and a bit of Tears here very very nice I've been gone for my Strictly Come Dancing issues with a black soft and a pink toe and the next customers is my Gucci mum off bag in yellow and my crazy ass earrings I just thought the gold in the earrings tiding with yellow path good morning everybody you are currently being propped up by some form of kitchen utensil but I just thought I should catch you all up because last time I throw to you was a Saturday night and I wasn't in the best mood however I am now and even though having a really really good night probably one of the best nights back in a long time with us today and I ended up quite like in my outfit quite cash and quite comfortable and yeah I just kind of like got myself a double gin and tonic and felt so so much better and had a real life with my mom my dad saying max it was just such middle of enactment see James Perry for some dinner which was really nice actually and then went over to Jimmy's of course and had a little more drink it was such a great night in there such good vibes so yeah feeling much better yesterday I just I wasn't hung over I just feel that I earned my bed sheets I have never time a bed sheets in my lap so I feel like I'm a fullyfledged I don't know I'm a bed sheet change the bed did a few ironing of shirts again something I don't really do that often I don't really I am and I started watching it and give us some examples yeah girl off really quite like it bit silly and a bit annoying like the character she's gorgeous and she's like new style icon for sure and made it and what is it she's a bit annoying but I quite like it you need you watch Emma just half an hour episode so I definitely recommend it if you're into fashion and you want something easy to

motivation a todo list and a happy kid I'm gonna put you down to charge you up because your battery's dying very sorry everybody I'm also I think my bump has popped up today so I'll show you a bit of a bump shop later but yeah a good start to the day eight years ago I bought these from Amazon straw tastic the court hang on let's focus on that they go Mintos straw tastic I bought the from Amazon not much money that's all and they're just the best toy ever you love them don't you yeah and she's making a house we've got a firm solid structure to it thank you over the top and make a little den yeah pretty cool oh okay Darcy wants tool to see that she is wearing her top backwards that's a choice she's made I'm gonna let her do it and I'm gonna show you some the clothes I bought for Darcy recently and I've just been sort of keeping to one side to show you so this was her awful sprinkle glitter this was from a shop in Brighton called happy ology and they had a 50% sale on so it wasn't 19 pounds it was like nine pound fifty and it's is really really sweet top with a double peter pan collar which i think is really nice and i thought it's been really nice with skinny jeans it's very very thin and then the back has this button detailing and i like the way it finishes at the bottom there there's it a little tshirt from Jules again I think this was was this one in the sale probably no three four I got something else with it life's peachy and I really like the spotty print of this you'll be seeing more of that in a second and then along with the deal I got this tshirt sassy party lalala like tea party thought that was fun and then it's the other thing this dress absolutely love I think I've seen quite a bit of a portion for the doggy Spotty's it has lime detailing just there before it cracked so that was nice and then finally this was another trip to Jules but this time in the sales so instead of 32 pounds it was 12 pounds and this is for autumn so I might include this in an autumn hawk because it's really thick it's like a lovely thick wool texture and it's still fun and bright and has all this aspect detailing on and Suzi's I bought these little shoes with my songs think that absolutely gorgeous super cute and we'll go with tons of things I also got her a little pad lunch box and for the new term yeah that's it a little haul for you now though I've tied it well

like hi what are these what are these what are these purple flowers what is this it's absolutely lovely out here so I'm gonna do some dinner I had thought about going for what Casati is so hyper today I find the best thing to do with an over like energetic child is just so like exercise them so it's like let's go to self play run around and but such a nice evening but look at that not a cloud in that while there are clouds in the sky actually yeah we might go for a little walk around the village perhaps go to the reservoir or something I'm so happy right now I love this this season of life is nice I'm pregnant and summer my kid is happy and my boyfriend likes me which it's nice he loves me yeah it's good good good try not to worry because he's done this before he comes back dusty has had a strawberry porridge I just want to have a multi treat yoghurt oh you've seen the yoghurt have you yeah I forgot where I filmed up to I might not have even filmed this morning I don't know but here with a very special guest it's Alison Perry from not another mummy blog and she's doing a podcast what is your podcast called I'm wearing people Frank and that what cast is called not another mummy podcast happy what you've done there yeah and I'll be launching on iTunes very soon it's exciting and as you can just see we are in a very professional set up with boxes and I believe I didn't reserve that there's a toilet roll just in shock that I had the round all tied it up and then and some I guess some of carpet I was like yep definitely just give me two seconds right so we're gonna film this oh I'm so embarrassed um Allisyn cruelly made me do a task where you have to show what's in your handbag oh that's that's classy that's a good job that you weren't videoing this is these like beige straps showing and this was what was the contents just a ton of shit and junk but you assure me that you also have a ton of shit and drunk I'll going like 10 times there ain't no shitting jumping you is their shit and drunkenness no that's that's that's my little work rucksack oh thank is downstairs okay good but you just keep this sort of job me in there guess who's just filmed a home Whitehall it's me to me look at all these goodies if you want to know more about them during this lot cheaper chappy cheapy chappy cheeky chappy I'm head on over to my main channel which will sprinkle a little to watch that all it's a bit later on in the day now it's about five o'clock and my auntie Judith dropped round this box the other day she read my book world like me and she said that when she read it she felt like my not some of my mum was coming through so I'll explain more so she sent me this one note it says Louise you and Jane are so alike you will know for sure when you read these letters love Judith so Jane is my mum and Judith younger sister and it's a whole box of letters that my mum wrote to Judith obviously when she was alive if you don't know my mum died when I was seven and so emotional reading them wait a second I can't not look teary I've tried that I'm just an emotional person and I'm hormonal and it's about you know my mum so I'm gonna be emotional it's just so strange to like have these things but like my mum has touched and I haven't seen her for like 25 years this this December and I miss her so much all the time especially I'm pregnant because it makes me so like it breaks my heart that she hasn't held it hasn't felt the weight of Darcy's she won't feel this baby either and just reading these things I like having her like talk to me and hearing there's always she said things like this a bit here it says back to work I got my friend his house back to work put the wrong blouse on by mistake Betty nearly blew a fuse so I don't care less this trouble to him until the flowers come out rather press flowers any day rather press flowers than this any day because my mum used to press flowers for Crawford I just love I don't know who Betty is full of that my mom wore the wrong brass blouse and couldn't give a shit look at bosses crows about it sorry had a message come through yeah so it's just really nice and then this one so I wanted you sowed things and she's put did Judith thank you for the dress it really fits a treat I wish she could have seen it I will put it on for you the weekend before I go she looks nice and fresh in it this was a fly she looks nice and fresh in it this leaves a good idea and when it's very hot she will be cool in her arms won't get sunburned Steve thought it was lovely to like that was me that was me that she planning dresses she was glad my arms in it there but to me that's like a little slice of love but someone cared about my arms not burning and I didn't know that I don't bend and now I do what it's like having a little extra bit of somebody who had so long I crave so much this is so lovely but also like so anyway I thought I'd lock this because I want to document it and how much she means to me and how much of a big part of my life she is a bodacious and my weight she isn't so we are so I'm gonna read a couple more but I'm not gonna read them all at once because I want to savor them and make them last a bit so it's this card and she'd obviously gone to America because we've got family over there so she's put did you death it's Sunday nearly a week since I left and this is the first real chance I have had to have a quiet moment to write it's 7:30 a.m. louise has gone back to bed up since 5:00 a.m. and the others are asleep all her times are out but I go to bed at 9:00 p.m. so it's okay just about got over the jetlag it's a very long flight 12 hours but Louise was good all the American ladies are making a fuss of her because she's plump and like their Gerber baby on all the baby packets apparently all their babies are thin so it's different to see a fat one that's all fatty me couldn't be happier and watching a documentary about Princess Diana's who was brilliant and Liam has made me dinner which is brilliant I'm a happy woman I've got free tickets hello was you like the information that's linked below for you that's not good your mom why would you worry myself around good morning

bigger than any problems anyone else has my eyebrow pencil ran out mister benefit grew free from ordering another one today so I've had to use various eyeshadows and like an eyebrow brush to do it so that's been a big problem today are wearing this little dress from yours from their like bumper collection and I really really really love X it's so stretchy and the boobies Vicky's here coffee shut hello yeah my dad's popping round in a minute and then I've got to get on one load of writing those who are sort of stuff say that's the day it's nail day and that's not kid ourselves at the most exciting thing about that is finding and I have Chloe has kept to her resolution I decided I'm gonna keep this up all year I mean we've gone over half a year now so far and if she has kept up with the whole year I'm gonna buy her like a new bedspread or something better okay let's find out we all know what we all want to know yes slowing internet sensation how's it been going with the resident rates I actually got new bedding and survived mailing them oh my god from general like they're they are such it and they're soft and I'm sure he saw see me love it sure you'll absolutely be devastated to hear that I haven't really looked much else today I came back and edited the sleepover blog which has gone up now it's one of those blogs but I was like this is like the most amazing idea my whole life and together I was like or is this like a super lame video idea so go over to sprinkle clutter and watch that and you can be the judge of whether that video is a good idea or not slightly biased audience so if you're watching this already so different goodness for that we as in me and Liam are going out now to some of Liam's family's house for a dinner do dinner party job' so I'm just come

"no_SOCIAL MEDIA vs REAL LIFE  Lily Pebbles Vlog.txt"	"good morning everyone I make up three actors women today I'm heading to Brighton I'm going down to see Anna spend the day with her and we need to film a couple of videos and if you can be so nice to catch up but I thought I'm just going to head off early I'm dropping rich as a dentist and I'm going straight to Brighton I'm still obviously mummy and I get there it'll be much more enjoyable so I'm just quickly having a little bit of breakfast and then I'm going to drive because I normally get a chain definitely easier to get the Train sometimes you just fancy a long drive in a warm car with radio and so I will probably touch you when I get to Brighton Pyrates have a nice day at work I've arrived at Anna's laps and it's so nice to be back here again we are Anytus prepping for our videos I realized too yummy a heavy makeup on so I'm going to do my makeup which is in this lovely Arsenal's London bag but I got sent and I really like it complete like a nadir obviously of your home I know me too Anna and I are about to film a couple of videos so I can't film them because it's a little bit of a surprise this a throne it is a this apron and might give something away actually is a little baking we're totally baking animal afternoons will hopefully remain forever so we're going to try and do these videos I'll vlog a little bit along the way and show you some of the baking and then it'll be a whole afternoon of eating our baked goods which I'm very excited for I don't to give too much away but we have finished this is my end result I'm going to wash my face now it's really fun baking with a friend you should try it now we had will be baked goods yes you thought we'd invite some people round to eat them and so we've asked Lily Melrose and Zoe if they want to come round because they both live in Brighton and it because you so nice season we're going to catch up like this we've all known each other since 2012 I say yeah a long time we're like some of the original London the blogger crew now no one lives in London apart for me yes because other people have seen them and keeping lots of cake in Crystal easy stuff we've realized that we've had too much too much stuff already and we're craving something savory so Anna's going to make us an avocado on toast which are really yummy chili flakes I've been enjoying it's a bit of chili flakes I have a condo dish not saying I'm not saying work coaster as well Anna's made me avocado internships great weirdest thing we think advertisers are most stressful vegetable because you just never know when the right time is cut them open and sometimes to earlier like that and that you can't even eat like my condo and I feel like I just don't do it with you right behind I still eat it but it's too far gone I just like missed it missed the slot and we didn't found an old log so real all in and I said I have to get my camera you can all see it oh my god nearly and Zoey just left and I'm really sorry to have a blog but we've been like reminiscing about old blogging times it's actually really late now it's half sick I have to go home me and Anna have done anything we were supposed to do we had a long list of things to do but we ended up the plug and fun with Sir Ian Lilly bar so maybe like a Mark Toner is the daily drama party specific I just walked into the flats I am home that was a bit of an epic journey her in there other there was actually no traffic but my Google Maps took me really weird route that I didn't know and if I needed my eyesight I really struggle to read Google Maps when it's on night mode and I kept turning off the wrong exits and doing all these things wrong and ending up in really weird places so I'm happy to back also all I've eaten all day with avocado on toast so I'm feeling really like shaky and I feel like I haven't eaten enough today so I phoned rich from my handsfree like an owl before getting home and I said please can you order your Domino's because we were chatting about Domino's all afternoon and it made me want one so I just go home and I've got a pepperoni and mushroom Oh looking you get you look super fancy Italian one from Domino's that mean you're feeling better than rich wasn't feeling very well today sorry I wasn't here to look after you while you were at work I am so ready for this and garlic and herb dick I hope one is enough this is my favorite stuff I just pour it all over rich got a little mini bottle of chili oil with his mind all focusing oh it's so cute oh my god Domino's was so good I needed that sometimes you just need a dominance I had such a nice day today I'm really aware that I didn't vlog much the morning Anna and I spent filming as you saw and then when I got Anna's I basically said for her why don't we message Zoe and Lily because they both live in Brighton and they're sort of people we always say when we see them oh we should do something and then we never do and I don't know if you guys know this about me like all my real life friends know that but one of my favorite things in life to do is to bring people together I feel like I'm a friend matchmaker like I love it when all my friends become friends which is why I have such a solid group of friends because I introduce everyone to everyone and I love when people become friends I love bringing everyone together and I don't know it's just like a massive part of my personality so I said why don't we didn't fight them around and they can eat cake with us so I messaged OE on Twitter and Lily on Twitter and they both were up for it we've all known each other since the very beginning of blogging when there were that many people blogging in the UK and it is like not even YouTube this is like mainly beauty blogger thing so it feels like they're old friends even though we don't look at see double all the time and they came out at 2 o'clock and left at 6 we had four hours of chatting about everything we like reminisce about old times we looked at funny old blog posts and talked about some of the first blogging events we ever went to and old beauty products that we were obsessed with and then we talked about everything like what will all up to now and how we're finding things and it was so nice I just really really enjoyed it there's such good people just really like decent noncompetitive lovely girls it was so nice so I didn't really end up vlogging because I feel like when I'm enjoying myself I'm not thinking about like already to get the camera out I've logged a bit when we were looking at old blog posts old videos and stuff but we just chatted and it was so nice and then I drove home and you guys know what happened after that I feel really like warm and fuzzy now after today I was watching either end Emilia's vlog yesterday last night and it was the vlog which I think she called what you don't see on Instagram or something like that and she tagged me and a few other girls actually talked about something which I don't know is how many people talk about but it's kind of how social media is kind of the perfect the perfect part of someone's life you see but how it's really important to remind everyone and talk about how it's not reality how social media Instagram especially you probably like the best photo of yourself in your surroundings and you want to make it beautiful but that it's really important to remind yourself that it's not real and not to compare yourself to this person Instagram life I definitely in the past have done that by try really hard not to and I try really hard on all my platforms to try and keep it as real as possible for me it's not so much about showing you guys how I put up the perfect photo but really it's not that perfect because I saw like oh do you try and keep it real but something I took away from Amelia's log that made me think about is how what you see of someone's life online is such a small part of their life and as a viewer I'm also view of other people's videos it's really important to remind yourself that for example I vlog once a week I have a vlog go up every Wednesday and usually around 10 minutes and I think it's quite easy when watching vlogs to think that that's that person's life you should think about it is ten minutes of an entire week I personally don't really show much of it feels like I show a lot but I don't show me and rich cuddling on the sofa or being intimate together being that loving we're not really the sort couple that like through PDAs we're not like that a lot of people we're very private about it also as much as I try and be completely natural in front of the camera when I get a camera on you've got a camera in your face of the screen and a tripod you're naturally in like camera mode I'm always a little bit sarcastic and trying to be funny as much as I don't want to be I have a very sarcastic humor and it naturally comes out when I feel myself but when the camera's not here and I'm not always like that and I think it's important when watching someone to know that it's just a tiny part of their personality and a tiny part of their week and there's so much more to the story and so much more going on and you never really know and if you think you know a youtuber you probably don't and I think that's something we can all remind ourselves every now and again they really know where this is going really I'm trying to be more positive online I really hate it when people think that I'm negative and monie because my real life friends would never ever describe me as negative yes I say how I feel a lot are through that air about today she said it's just part of my personality that if I'm feeling a certain way I'll say it and I have strong opinions about things but I'm definitely not a negative person I actually think I'm quite a positive person but I don't know maybe sites tears my humor it comes across online as negative and I find it really sad that that's how people some people perceive me I know my true friends and family know my true personality so that all good I feel like I've got so much to catch up on because I didn't look at my phone all afternoon because I was chatting and now I don't know what's going on in the world my friend Keisha is home she lives in New York she's been in Miami for work and then she had a job in London and she extended her stay for a couple of days so she's here this weekend and I'm going from lunch with her tomorrow which I'm really looking forward to because I love when I get to hang out with her it's also my friend Hannah's birthday tomorrow and she's having a surprise party in a pub she has no idea it's her 30th and she thinks that everyone just like isn't bothered about her

caramel sauce so I feel really fat right now I'm so bloated I need to do a weight video cuz I'm I've gained a lot can you see how bloated I am I look pregnant I've gained a lot of weight really quickly not in the best way but I'm gonna fix it because I got really skinny really quick and then my body went into starvation mode so now it's just holding on to any food that I think which is really annoying but it's fine I'm skinned um get in the shower now I'm not having dinner because I've had so much food I feel just disgusting I'm gonna tie you up a little bit and then probably just write down a few video ideas and stuff and plan out my day for tomorrow because I'm at home all day tomorrow which is amazing so I'm just gonna try and get some stuff done but I'm gonna start a like smoothie slash juice cleanse tomorrow just to like detox my body because I've just been eating so well I've been eating better now but when I gained the weight back I was just eating loads of rubbish and like binge eating and I feel like I'm still been doing it a little bit but I'm a lot better so I'll explain this all cuz I'm gonna do a video on it but I'm not trying to go on a diet or anything it's just I'm trying to shed like the excess cuz my eyes and my bum are quite fatty now like whereas before they were really toned which I don't like and I just feel uncomfortable all of my clothes are way too tight on my waist which like my stomach was the one place I never gained weight I've always been so flat stomachs because I've been lucky in that sense and so I just need to get back to myself and sort out my metabolism so that's why I'm doing that but I probably I think what I'm going to do is have movies and juices all the way until dinner and then just have like a really healthy dinner maybe for like a week just to sort myself out because I need to and it's gonna make me feel better as well anyway I'm gonna get a shout out because I'm a sweaty mess"	1961
"no_STEVEN HAS MY TEETH"	"check out my sexy goggles guys and Beth have impressions of my sixteenth see you first to see this oh my god firmly painful nice job you think'll any hours in dentistry so this guy's is my mouth can you guess which ones up and which ones to hell so I'm just back from the dentist it was the most pain free experience and mental areas because my dentist is lovely so next week I go back and show me how to fit them and then there's like a cream I presume that goes in and then I get lucky white teeth now I'm not saying my teeth aren't white but it should I guess because I'm like filming and taking photos but I can kind of see that they used to be a lot whiter and since I found coffee and let all other things yeah my teeth and my smile just aren't as white as I'd like so it's like give it a go and then I thought I'd just share with you guys because it might be something you want and I also kind of when he goes to not be scare the dome tisk so if you've got a lovely dentist like mine it's actually quite a pleasurable experience you can smell something yummy on my fingers deep in the gorgeous boy people putting chewing gum on the floor means that dogs like Steven who had to roll around the floor get caught in effort I've been trying to get this off for a couple of days as you can see it's attached to his wrinkly skin and its really uncomfortable of him and it hurts when I try and take it off as you can see he's trying to bite me so guys think before you check your chewing gum please just look time in the rain and Leon's benefit from Key Stages head like a really hard day and night clients and I was just a bit stressed but obviously your book coming out and stuff so I've just treated him to a tree I don't know if you guys have got one we've got the Harriet it's just opened up here in marriage and it does the yummiest of treat so picked him up two things and they gave me one for free because they are legends but actually they said it was they didn't want to eat everything so I've literally picked up at the end of the day so technically I saved their waistline hello that's not all really thing and a roller thing and a something for the buttery goodness thing I'm going to go to the fin click now the skin connect estoy visited at the beginning of last year to help me with my skin and then once I was in there a kind of intrigued by laser hair removal now being a personal trainer that means I put my arms up a lot and to be honest I was getting really nervous and I've been insecure with a kind of dark sort of Homer Simpson shadows I had on my own pits now hair is beautiful it's just not something that I love and so for that reason I decided to try laser hair now I've been having it done pretty much the last five months of last year's was every six weeks I think I had six sessions in total and then I stopped because I didn't get any more hair now the reason why I loved it so much is because you it's like maintenancefree so basically continue as you would nominate so if you shave you just keep shaving and then every 6 weeks you go in and they laser you it takes about my first ones maybe like 30 seconds per armpit and then over time it's the quickest thing ever smells a bit weird smells like ass or firm hair um it's not paying free it's a bit like like a sort of hot flick so it's uncomfortable for the first one it's still bearable like I'm uses with paint stuff but it's just a really weird feeling but it's over so quickly like it's 15 seconds you can kind of grin and bear it but today I'm heading back because it's been 23 months since I last went in and I just wanted to check up if there's any little additional hairs they're going to zap them away and i think there's four but i'm going to let you guys look at my armpit this is my right armpit i have not shaved in the last five months and this is my left armpit that has been shaped the same I don't weirdly just shave one on pit not the other and it feels so soft like you know those adverts where people the boyfriend kisses the girlfriends armpit I think it's late Nivea or sure or something and I'm like oh my god I've never let anyone do that because my armpits would basically like their face on fire cuz it was so prickly now I would happily go Leon lick my armpit not like it and sniff it not sniff it touch my armpit so now this infinite and we're going to get rid of like six head I have that just going to put a fine where it is we're going to do that now triumph rocket and who are you going to get enough of me taking a picture of my armpit awkward I've said to buy myself something new and it's makeup wolf make up a bull so I always see people talk about Anastasia Beverly Hills so I headed on to cult beauty.com and

we met one evening and I parts and and Hot Tuna illegal spot and God ticketing you got a speaker don't get tickets peevish we've had the most exciting day and I can't tell you why yet but you know what my video is going to get so much better hi guys that I have been a rubbish youtuber Steven says hello by the way I've had a lot going on this week some really exciting stuff but I just I don't want to film it because it's really exciting one make sure it happens and also I've been trying to train and just really get back in shape for you guys know that I'm in bad shape but I've been in better and so for that I kind of want to be a lot of selfish and train myself and if I'm filming it which I know you guys will want to see it means I'm not really working out that hard please there to stop and start and go back to it and really uneven assistance if anyone wants to be my assistant and amazing so I've kind of just been a bit selfish so this first weekly vlog probably isn't the best but it is an honest view of everything and then until I can tell you more stuff but something to expect something but something exciting did happen today and I've got my teeth my teeth so obviously you guys know that last week I went to go and see my dentist about getting the whitening stuff Stevens currently trying to eat the moles which I will show you and i'm going to show you the process so it's going to take six weeks may just pay see where these things that night let me show you chief steven no it's to them don't chew here and mean it don't pretend you're licking it that's a lie say hello to my teeth now please excuse my nails i'm doing it tonight these are my top teeth rrraaahhh and these are my bottom ones and this is just the mold they took on my god my nails are literally terrible and the Kaveri I'm okay moving on so leave the mod of my teeth and then I feel like I'm back to days of having braces so this is where I keep my teeth in out of the molds they've made these little plastic pretend ones basically I slot this in my mouth at night and they are so comfortable it fit me perfectly so unlike a lot of things you see where you know it's meant it you mold yourself is really difficult or most be wondering their teeth are only getting the front they're not getting the back because they can't mold it so front and back and I'm going to wear them tonight I've already tried them it doesn't even feel like a quick money I sound a bit weird but that's about it then what I do is you have this box which is full of syringes I sound like a drug dealer and basically this is for six weeks and I have one syringe but every three days so here's my first syringe and I went syringe doin what do it hold on Stevens got my teeth Steven no no given out of the mouth David I leave anything around today okay so I syringe this into here and around here and then I just wear over nine in the morning I take off from brush my teeth as normal and apparently I shouldn't notice much like sensitivity or anything but I will obviously let you guys know so I'm going to be doing this every day as much to remember you don't have to do every day but obviously the sort of more often use it the quicker the progress will be and I should be able to go a couple of shaved ice I say there's my teeth now and we'll see what happens and now i'm about to do a plank off for good morning britain so wish me luck i will link my dentist who's done this he's amazing he's lovely and so anyone who obviously is local to me so norwich london oh really if you're in the UK because you might want to travel he's great and you can just see what happens with my teeth see you guys next week love you bike back to my channel so today's video is all about stress eating which is another video I know you guys have been requesting me for and it's something very close to my heart I was something I experienced a lot during 2015 and I'm determined that 2016 is not going to go the same way so last year when things were all going crazy and incredible I found myself sneaking off to the shop just around the corner from the gym"	2625

"no_Super Cosy  The Weekly #32.txt"	"good morning I'm starting the vlog on a cold and rainy Monday morning we must be approaching Austin we've just got to do it errand doodles and I we're heading back to the car now no doubt like tonight but what about that late to do that oh that's exciting we can set up right I'll tell you know liam is working nights tonight so said astok asleep in my bed and I'm

breakfast in bed tomorrow morning make it a spa okay works you say but also I want to bend it with doodles so yeah we've popped into coop I'm not sure we're gonna make carrots and streets on their own are they we've got lots of edge at home in the fridge so if I were picked up some tangerines bananas good idea good idea I'm 21 weeks pregnant today and I am living the moment that I can indulge in blue cheese again it's one o'clock I've just finished editing a video doing for London Midland Dustin I had a really fun day out in London on Friday actually I was reading I said it that like see all the little memories and also London Midland are doing a thing you'll see in that video that's pretty cool now I look this is your first ignore all that that needs hanging up little glimpse of all the baby bits now I'm searching for Darcy's swimming cause that we have so many here we go okay for this one because I've got so much work to do today throughout the summer holidays when I ever have Darcy basically just suck off what I couldn't like have fun days with her but it's all caught up on me a bit so Liam has just got back he's just bought a new car because his old one didn't have ISOFIX fixtures and one with the baby that's gonna need to be in a nice a fixed thing and also his old car is getting a bit old and blah blah blah I also need to get a new car because I can get Darcy and quite comfortably and my car does have isofix this is so boring isn't it why much of you want I so fix things it's to do car seats anyway and we are going swimming now what we generally do generally what we tend to do when I've got loads and loads of work on is I'll get Darcy ready in the changing rooms walk her through to the pool Liam or do something with her I watched through this big window in a cafe and try get some writing done and then I'm giving a thumbs up I go and get her until the change room stuff I just rambled for a really long time about really pouring mum stuff I recited to cut it out we're going swimming and that is that and I'm gonna do some writing we're back in the writing season the back in biz trying to get the next wild book done I'm on a bit of a time crunch because you know I got pregnant I got knocked up and now I have to get all my stuff done before I push a tiny human out of my vajay so when people say what she deadlines my deadline is for when my baby comes out that's my deadline anyway enough chat let's go and do this Soapy's calls just over there so I can watch those little leather couch and get my mind into like creative zone and see if I can get some writing successful written about Astrid words I'm really happy with them got into the rhythm a bit a bit more talked about as a new character and if it's up to her old tricks and reintroduce Lacey again it doesn't and she said Darlington she's talking about something that's happening going on in her life um it's really nice it's like good back it's really nice to go back to like all the old characters it's nice of a new one but I'm really enjoying the old one like that I know bu it just feels really nice fighting book too I thought that like it was well I'm sure it will get hard but right now it's still like in there all this is so lovely like visiting a warm friend so I'm really enjoying it I'll keep giving updates as the week's go on I won't give any spoilers but so many people don't like that but do you feel free to leave any questions and if it's ones that the answer wouldn't give away a spoiler then I'll try not to written it in the next week anyway I have to go and get Darcy now and do the changing room stuff with her go back we stopped off at TK Maxx and I've lost love a little bit Sony baby and Liam bought a guitar as you do what's it called a stack was that just the name of the back no it's a Fender really enjoyed listening to some without alrighty this afternoon and I can't wait to hear loads loads more every day ok it's 7 o'clock and we're all set up for our hotel my aren't we Darcy has made the bet I need to put fresh sheets on it but before I did that Darcy has made the bet in well you can you can see for yourself tada just my maternity pillow down the middle I just put all that you have and we're gonna watch Nativity when do you want to watch Chris's films the 21st of August that's when you want to UM see what else I've got if she's gonna watch yeah we've got baby Annabelle it's just their blanket on the floor just in case a dressinggown all sorts of things ah we're gonna snuggle up together and liam is not going to be here tonight because working nights it's just me and doodles and it's gonna be you just following me around doing both scepter any well for hotel like it's lovely what kind of day would we say this grey day happy birthday my sister hates that I'm filming a because she looks oh that's very mature Tiana very good well then Tiana how old are you today lookie lookie the postman's Ben I'm excited I really hope this is a ball ball I thought on how to say I said look you look is Zoe by the way come and join us at Savannah's winter wonderland I've read the invite and chummy I'll tell you this personally I want to come but I can't because I have Darcy that day and I'm in London the next day for something so I won't be comin but I will be hanging this and obviously supporting you and all that you do and all the things you bring out and I'll be saving this to pop on my tray looks like a snowman doesn't it Judas please yeah tada I've made a bit of an effort today of usually the front of my hair desperate needs a wash and like put a hairband on and like put some red lipstick on a staff um I didn't vlog last week and I thought I ought to just quickly address that um for the last few weeks I've been feeling a little bit less than my usual super peppy self I haven't been feeling like depressed or super down or anything just been feeling a bit like just emotionally tired and not really get having a lot to give to the vlogs and I decided that what I did have in terms of energy and like emotional wellbeing I should be giving to other things like myself or my family and people around me I don't think that there's any one thing that has really dragged me down I think there's just been a couple of little things on top of just feeling a bit more tired than they usually would and I was wearing my maternity jeans day in day out with a tshirt so it's comfortable and just stopped feeling good about myself and then stopped feeling good about myself and then had to deal with like lots of life bits also and I decided that rather than carry on trying to make the weekly vlog look really happy and exciting which I feel like I was struggling to do because I mean if you're not feeling super happy and exciting then I mean how to make your life seen have been exciting and so it's all right I don't this isn't compulsory why am i I don't need to fake something I don't need to make something people will understand and you know I'm not contracted to do a video week so if I feel like it's not gonna be a great video and I don't want to like turn a camera on myself every two minutes I just won't so it just didn't I wasn't actually going to make a video at all but then I felt compelled to make the video I did make which was slightly unusual slightly interesting about my thoughts on God which is not for everybody I know if you want to come watch it there if you don't that's totally fine I wasn't expecting it to be like a million views in a day kind of a video um however having that break has really really helped which sounds crazy because I don't consider weekly vlogging particularly challenging because you're just picking up the camera showing what you're doing anyway but just having that space to use all the energy I had on people and myself and just being a bit kinder to myself I suppose like I made an effort with my clothes and I put makeup on I liked and I text friends that are you free and I had all the girls around for a hot tip night which is really nice I know lots of you gonna be like kind of hot already pregnant it's not a prank it's a safe setting and just made more of an effort and which is carried on into this week as well I'm seeing in fact we're gonna go to see friends it's after Newton and stuff like that um so feeling a lot better and a lot happier and less and learnt is that when you feel a bit mad the worst thing you can do is hide away in your nightie and watch Downton Abbey on repeat it's not gonna help you I see life lesson right now I have to go and wrangle the troops and get ready because we are going to an adventure playground rightytighty my friend I'm at it's late righty tighty but look what I just found you look ah Lucy a load of parasha and I feel like this is going to be essential today because every every park with it needs some luxury chocolate very much just be general woloson some of those fried right big boots which is not to dog one must black and one was golden and they were both the same they're like twins but not if they come back if they come back out run get sneaky sneaky shot the twin dogs twins but not by treating ourselves to arrive on a train with the kids we're excited I've come mad I'll show you something Sushi's for you it's alright starting Wednesday okay a different location dropped off this morning here Vesta and her many chill have bruised her litter box home so that sounding the day with much love why I decided oh my gosh biting you I'm off home yes lovely yeah went to TK Maxx in the chapter first time I've been in she came back some other home since Cal I don't like it it's really they found it was overwhelming and all the clothes I don't like that rifling through business or like it to be like I quit into next you can see what's what but in places like that you can't and that stresses me that's how I feel about a lot of shops such Nick but I didn't like the baby section and I'll show you some bit sort of popped this little outfit here gray and yellow and white and it's got a little tiny hippo Nobu and and the leggings have bows and this is for size six months just you know like this and that only cost $9.99 which I thought was a lovely full outfit that they're all there so at six months will be in summer so that would be perfect for her and you'll see a theme to all of me I thought this little outfit for $9.99 as well similar to the other one it's got the little headband does that have a bow on it as well I don't get it yet if it does and a little peter pan collar and not like floral motif and then spotty leggings with a little bowwow and then last but not least I bought that in M three months so that I'll be sort of March time and then also in three months I bought this house this little bit and when Darcy saw this she was like which one's me and which ones baby yeah don't say her name which ones baby so we picked her which was which and then it's just this little polka dotty that Dalmatian top and then the leggings they have feet I thought that was so cute and that was a snip at $7.99 which I thought was pretty good and then also small named 1/8 of order came and this isn't my sister my sister Tiana turned 21 this week it's okay to show these because you she will have got them but I'm seeing her Friday night and Tiana is obsessed with Dinosaurs like crazy obsessed she got my Instagram I see a picture of her and she listened their dinosaur suit so basically I'm going to just give her a load of dinosaur stuff and I'll either give her a bit of money or she actually owes me some money so I might just be like to have to pay me all of that back because she's you don't let me see I've got the chain a bit mixed up oh here we go so cold chain and send this like no weird leather dinosaur I think this looks a little bit dominatrix II but my sister's pretty edgy what sanctions dominatrix my sister is a dominatrix that's the title in this video also nothing wrong with her she is I suppose this is taken a turn but and here we are this is the bag but a bra and then also the megabowl I ordered her these happy 21st yadayada decent sleep so monitor these sexy slippers and I've also ordered a couple of bits on not on the high street like some other dinosaur themed things so hopefully she'll really enjoy opening all her very mature dinosaur things I actually think that she will like this and they we're out and about and stuff and you have to follow her on Twitter or something see if she does this is what my afternoon just editing my videos this will be up on my main channel sprinkleofglitter which by the way I've had a bit of a rejigger so oh my God look at these how much do you want those in your actual own life

"no_The Back Yard & The Boat  Billy & Pat.txt"	"hey it's Billy and it's pat and here's a little recap of some fun stuff we did this weekend hello it's Sunday we are in the backyard because we are going to do some planning for what we want to do with the backyard long term so this summer hi Billy we're kind of prepping so you can see it's like what did you describe the backyard like the backyard is basically like Pride Rock after scar takes over it just is like a dead zone it's a lot of students use to park their cars back here at last one on they got four or five cars parked in the yard for years so this yard needs to be rototilled we have a lot of work to do right at the end of summer because that's kind of when you want to put any grass down before the colder weather yeah so that next summer we can just start straight with like design yeah so what we're doing now is we're measuring all the cussing shed we got to get rid of too we're doing some measurements so that when we wrote a till we have a kind of planned out because I think what we're going to do is put some like raised planter beds right along the driveway to kind of like frame it out and we can grow vegetables we don't have to put them into cotton like we've been doing so we're just going to kind of you know do some prep now make really good so I can look at them with my shirt off okay so this would go ten feet three inches so we're measuring to see where these like metal planters that we found online that we think you want to get like how they would look and how many we would need and how much that may cost with you know Brian is in the window being really adorable hey buddy was that about 8:30 in the morning and I'm down at silo city for creativemornings things that happens a lot of different cities just where people from the creative community can come and get together and either speaker or any kind of network and they're at very cool settings of this one is at silo city and we're going to go on to this boat that's been restored they're doing some performances and things this weekend which I think Billy and I are going to go to later but it should be fun and I'm giving a 30second pitch about some projects that I'm working on so wish me luck we're back at silo city on the SS columbia our friend brad is here if you're working on the project i'll put some links in the video description so you can learn more about it like we're getting a little tour of the boat and the restoration and then i think we're going to have drinks and nibbles what do you think of the ballroom is awesome looks really cool you want to dance okay came upstairs to our back balcony hi Billy so we could kind of show you the backyard a little bit more in full so it's a nice shape we kind of have this big rectangle with a little extra part over there at the end of the driveway probably all of your garage back in the day yeah which we had it that you have out that'd be nice but that will add that to the bucket list but what are you thinking for back there Billy so we're going to do two metal planters like on each side of the driveway just to start we really have to get to rototilling and the brass sounds that summer and fall like next summer we're going to do a lot more of the landscaping outside putting a fence in but fun things the fun things so right now we got to do like the crucial things that are like end of season have to get the grass going yeah so we do know we want to get these two planters in and that is a good start yeah I think it will like really frame things out and we'll start to be able to fill in and visualize like oh that's where we want to put it feeding and over here is where we want to put a hot tub and I really like it because it's corrugated metal planters which I too might have Iceland I love that kind of like the wavy metal kind so this is to be a little more sturdy than wood so if here we thought for that we've got to get to work so thanks for joining us for another little weekend in recap of what we've been up to I guess we'll be making more of these right cool but we'll see you soon bye oh thank you Vanna now just get to making all this look man okay I should crash"	885

peaceful and then we sort of work out but now we're up we are ready for today that's going to get some breakfast and then we're going on a boat trip but first of all can I just show you this I mean it's just unbelievable you don't get used to it every morning I just wake up where they just think I've never seen anything like this absolutely amazing by a catamaran sailing but we haven't left yet now a little time for lunch I'll get does this work it's a beach shave avocado on the top cucumber smarter explosive emission Julie Emrick are at me having lunch in the lagoon beautiful Wow lovely little hot yeah mushroom and some macro parameters tell me we can make this on a boat in the middle of the ocean gorgeous there is trimming out thought you're asleep then I'm going to come and join you forgive me as I can that was the best day copy over that boat trip was just insane the boat was called Moana and the team were just unbelievable just absolutely loved it I still can't believe that they managed to cook all of that incredible food on the road and but the water is crystal clear solutely nice or even like round our hotel we're staying at the Ritz in Cancun and the water is closed forever even on the boat it was even clearer and you can see starfish and we went snorkeling and one of the guides found by the fish and we could call the fried additional hands and yes it's absolutely amazing especially rug and but we've now compact the wrists and we have this lovely Cabana and we've been in the Cabana for the last couple of days and we've got a hammock and everything is just absolutely ideal this is our little Cabana and let me give you a quick tour so this is our gorgeous peeking stomach that we haven't obviously been in that monkey to be Josephine anamorphic and we've got this double some bears little curtains and King four and then it is very being effective sometimes when you're lying down here and lady comes and then we had massage because the cucumbers on your eyes and then I'm really called one or your forehead you can choose treatments home refreshing and on our first day we brought over she's incredible cocktail in a pineapple like a whole pineapple and they'd carved a parrot outs at the top of the clinic or in put it in the top I actually put me in scraps so that's a really bad description going look at my histogram and see what I need and I think we're just going to for a while and then we cooked dinner reservations later but planning to think about food right now cuz I'm still full from lunch so play it a little bit of a sleep on the beach read my book ballot liquids just and right frozen mushy oh I nearly throw your lines which it goes fast for a smarty by refreshing it's such a freaking second speed Grover's algorithm and some

"no_The Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich"	"morning everybody its Bank Holiday Monday and it's ten o'clock I was actually still quite early we work up quite early today for a bank holiday but we're just sorting out some stuff rich is busy painting the cupboard because it's this like green MDF stuff it needs quite a few coats so he's this is doing that so I can actually put stuff in it this week when he's at work I'm just getting ready and then I need to tidy it up because my office is such a mess like there's literally stuff everywhere it's a bit crazy so I'm gonna tidy all of that up and then I think when I had to Spitalfields you might do a bit shopping have some lunch I really want to go to West Elm it's annoyingly kind of in the wrong direction but like I haven't been there in ages and I really want to spruce up our flat a bit a little bit I feel like we haven't done anything to it in quite a while and it's just a little bit unfinished and I really wanna get a plant and some more greenery for the lounge and maybe look it I might make this wall a gallery wall so I might start thinking about that I'm planning that a bit so that's all that's going on now um I'm gonna start tidying up I've done all right with the cleaning up thing rich has done the first coat paint you have to do another one tonight this is looking give it I think it's gonna look really smart when everything's on it obviously we've taken the door off I'm gonna put my tripods and stuff and lights down there cameras there and then books and stuff on the shelves getting rid of the IKEA Alex so rich is gonna put it in the dump but in a section where people leave things you can take all these cool things you can have people if anyone wants an Ikea Alex with premade labels that say makeup foundation eyeliners there you go which button over there I hope someone takes it and enjoys it I think it looks good with all the other stuff I mean that ironing board is definitely competition but I'd say oh I can't Alex looks very good Rick you made sure it's empty I'm trying out this today it's from Sarah Chapman and its new and it's got like a lip filler that's loose you were they call it like a lip base on one side and then a tinted balm on the other and it doesn't come out tinted with it like changes on your lip it's a lip conditioner and I'm quite enjoying it so far we're just driving around around spit first tryna find some it sparks a bit of a pain today rich County focusing realize I'm a koala day yeah we need to find somewhere voids five minutes of driving around he's managed to park but we're not sure for a she allows parts of it so we might get a parking ticket it's like a red red zone but banking the leads confusing so we're just gonna walk at me apparently which is called trade it's just by Spitalfields they do really yummy lunches so we're going to go we had such a yummy lunch a trade seriously if you guys ever near likes pizza fills that sort of area go check it out they do the most amazing sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches I didn't have one this time I've had one before I had her it was chicken and bacon club but I swear it's so worth redder than it even sounds because the chicken was like slightly spicy and crispy and there was like an amazing spicy sauce and the bacon was so crispy so that's our reversing sound in the car it was so so delicious what did you have scrambled eggs with avocado no and did they say they get eggs imported over from India they get their eggs from Italy and they're like bright yellow and amazing and so delicious so definitely go check it out I think we're now gonna drive into town I don't know why thank Larry Monday with miss to be relaxing but I was like I really ought to go to West oh I haven't been to West Elm in so long I really want to get planta so we can get a little plant or a lounge and one whole little mooch maybe buy some ice bars is I just as I said like like a flattened even feel a little bit so feeling a bit spendy and I've got really sore lips so confuse that I don't know what has happened here I get cold sores this is like a dry patch I think it's from Camping's I'm so cold I should get a planter they didn't have any of the one I wanted apart from one and display and the guys and they're so nice they said they'd let me buy the one that was under splay they like emptied it for me so got a planter we're excited about guys it matches our dining room tiny genuinely descender any room it matches our chairs that are in our kitchen slash lounge and I think it's gonna look really good I was a little fast because it's like pretty peony season and I think now looked really nice in there and now we're getting at home base see if we can find a plant they've come to the sunshine garden center because this is like one of the best garden centers I think in London we're gonna try and buy a plant and also get some advice on looking after this plum because I don't want to kill it and I know I will so we're gonna go in here and see what we can find guys this is so exciting ok so this is the plant sweeter for myself we've been told what to get so we're getting two bags of this like cacti desert soil and then we're getting three motherinlaw tongues tongues of motherinlaw what are they called again these are like my favorite ones this is what I was looking for so we're gonna plant three of them in there and they get a grow tool and lovely and we gonna get one of these for the shelf and I think we have to name them this one definitely looks like a charlie 100% Charlie and it needs one when you think of a good name that's not like a motherinlaw Pam Carolyn Sally hopefully there's like our first child rich I'm gonna get home and plant them she said these are the hardest plots kill for they better be because that was an absolute fortune a couple guys spent that much on plants but it'll be in the background my videos hopefully so it's an investment it was all propelling myself through you know children home from the hospital look in your head if you're that great doing a food shop and buying all the essentials I don't know what these are but little bars they feel small and they play time to just go home and see my lips perfectly lip balm on if my lips say so before we do anything I'm just gonna throw the chicken soup on because then it could just boil and the longer it falls for the better it tastes it actually tastes better the next day but I need to use it tonight so I'm just like cutting all the veg doing all of that chickens on the go rich or stuffing newspaper and our shoes for some reason and then we can start all our plants and stuff over there I'm going to get rich to chop the Swede in half because I will actually chop my hand off otherwise please don't chop your hand off on YouTube the other side's way more balanced definitely this is the vod's that I picked up from West stone so it's like frosted turquoise I absolutely love it turquoise I took wise I always say it wrong in and I but that's really nice and I think we're gonna put the planter over here where there's awkward spaces so I'm gonna kind of start setting it up without Richard know he wants to help he's currently painting the cupboard and giving it a second coat so guys this is what the planter looks like these legs are separate so this is kind of sitting on top of hits you have much meat to lift up now our floor is one thing we all have to sort that out but I think it's really nice because it really goes with the other furniture and our flat um these are our chairs so it's the same it's the same style it's like our table and our chairs and I think it's gonna look really nice the plant will kind of just go up the wall where there's like this awkward space and it's also the direction I film in so hopefully it'll show up in the background on my videos so we're gonna fill this pot with this stuff that they gave us desert cactus and bonsai compost and then we're gonna replant we've bought three to fill this because it's huge one would have just looked weird so we've booked for three and make him just grow up together effort one bag in and so it Stephanie not enough I'm gonna put the other one in as well guys look how exciting this is and I did it all by myself without Rich's help I've depotted no repotted I don't know what the word is motherinlaw's tongue these are called we have three now they live in here and I love it that was so high pitched apparently they're gonna grow pretty tall and I'm excited about it because it's a small area look stand back a bit I didn't want them they kind of sprays out because it would be too much if you're like walk around the table so this one just goes quite upright and I really like it pull out the cactus family but it's not spikey I've added all the veg and stuck and stuff to the soup and now I've just like I need to turn it down a little bit more it's a simmering I put the lid on I'm gonna leave it there for an hour so in the meantime money myself a little far and rich is painting the cupboard still it's doing a good job looking very white man Richard decides a meal plan this week because we haven't food shops for about a month we're just such bad adults I didn't know how we eat I think sometimes rich picks things up on the way back from work and sometimes we get takeaway and I don't know I feel like a lesson a meal plan we just don't know what to buy and we both hate food shopping with a passion so we are gonna plan our meals and then order online with the Cardo so it comes tomorrow night or tomorrow day and then it's just done so I'm actually gonna use the lean machines but we're gonna just use this book this week and then try something us next week next week I think I'll soups nearly ready but I'm just sitting watching Kardashians and designing our wedding invite actually because we're designing it with an illustrator and it's kind of hard actually if you don't like the typical things that wedding invites say like I I hate all the normal wording that they have so we're just trying to think about what we really want to write on it and you have to have like RSVP stuff and is a little bit complicated so I'm just kind of going through that now and thinking about wedding invites good chicken soup yeah how good out of ten nine and a half and come on now you've tried mine you've tried my mum's chicken soup Wow I need yeah I know definitely missing them just good thing I'm gonna end my vlog here because we're just kind of doing wedding stuff and eating chicken soup and that's kind of also thanks for watching today's vlog and I'll see you guys in my next video"	2240
"no_THE CRAZIEST EMOTIONAL WEEK.txt"	"good morning everybody it is currently Tuesday and I didn't actually vlog yesterday and I didn't upload a vlog and I was on a complete streak and then it felt really weird should not be picking up my camera and vlogging but yesterday it was just one of those days where I needed to get loads done and I was in my pajamas and I just did not do any makeup or anything and it was a great day I've got a lot done though which is good so today we are heading to London because we need to beat illtrained for the popup shop which is so so exciting Alfie I think in his previous vlog he inserted loads of like clips of the guys that were there yesterday who were doing kind of like the initial setup can't so the decoration and things like that and then today we're gonna go in sign some more posters help in any way that we can and tomorrow is the day the shop opens so as you're watching this it is open so for any of you that may not have watched my previous vlog or you have no idea what I'm talking about me and Alfie and Joe we've kind of collaborated to do a one time exclusive load of collab merch and we're doing it in a popup store in comic garden Slingsby place I think is what it's called Slingsby Slingsby something's things we place 21 so if you're around it's open for 12 days if you're around come down say hi we're gonna be popping in randomly I actually don't know when I'm gonna go quite a lot of you are like when are you gonna be there I want to go when you're there I we don't have set days that we're all going to be there it's gonna be very casual on that kind of side of things it's not going to be like a meetandgreet situation it's just if we're there and we happen to be serving you that's what might happen but I want you guys to be just as excited to head down there to look at the merch if we weren't there than if we were if that makes sense if so weird that it's actually finally happening because it's been something that has been in the works for like a month now we have tried to turn this over extremely quickly we have not had a lot of time to do this at all so yeah it's cool that it's all happening I guess that's why it's called a popup just thought you'd have a bit more time there I kind of loved the outfit I have on today you may already see it you guys know I love a weird jumper this is from Zara and they have it in navy blue with navy blue pompoms and they have it in mustard with mustard pompoms and yes I did buy all three because anything with pompoms on to me is just the best thing you could possibly be wearing so I did get all three but this is my outfit so you've got the jumper and then I've just kind of roughly tucked it into my jeans these jeans are from where he's from I want to say H&M I think these hmm but I will get Alfie to double check they're really cool they're like highwaisted and then I've rolled them up because I also have on these which are like proper biker boots from Zara H&M these are from H&M my feet look tiny in these I accidentally ordered a size 2.5 I don't know how I did that I think when I was ordering online I got really confused and for a moment I thought 35 was a three but actually 36 is a three so all the shoes I ordered I did a little haul online all the shoes I ordered were in size 2 or a 2.5 but actually they fit me better so maybe my feet are shrinking is that a thing I don't know and I've got a little tshirt on underneath this because it is actually quite warm in this I've been packing my suitcase because we are staying in London tonight in an air B&B which I'm excited about because I do love a good air B&B and because we're staying overnight and then going to the shop opening tomorrow morning I've been packing my suitcase so yeah got a few little bits and pieces in there and just trying to get a bit organized Alfie's currently in a meeting so basically the second he gets that was meeting we need to hit the road and I have driven into central London before so I know I can do it again but I'm not gonna lie I'm quite nervous about it because driving in central London is terrifying everyone is so like impatient you really get that time to be a bit indecisive or a bit slow about decisions on the road so I'm gonna try and think screw everyone else I'm gonna drive at my own pace that's gonna be great that's what I'm telling myself anyway we arrived I got us here in one piece I'm so happy about it because I'm not gonna lie at one point it was kind of terrifying I was on a massive roundabout with like six lanes we're here it's all good when I on a taxi on our way to the shop haha I think we head downstairs to find Joe come on out Joe's already made a sign don't come in I'm having a dump its freeze but on this side look oh it says here it's free unlike my pops I'm very excited about this week I'm worried that I might actually quit you shoot we are currently signing I'm rolling posters into tubes which takes longer than we thought it would my makeup is all Mary I'll be trying to upload a vlog Joe snuck off somewhere as he always does I watch TV oh yeah that's the Oh rowella that's so funny who's watching me do

flipping mental there was so many people there was like a queue around beyond where anyone expected it to go which I think at one point was a five hour long queue and got very unsafe inside the shop just outside the shop and at the back of the shop basically due to the large amount of crowds outside we were also told that if we didn't leave didn't the entire shop would be shut down permanently like it wouldn't have reopened so we had to leave which was sad because we were prepared to stay and meet everybody on that first opening we weren't intending to we're intending to like pop in as an but you know just pop in for a couple of hours and like see the opening and see how it went and then we were like oh there's so many people let's let's see it bless to stay the whole time I would be really nice to on this first day well we're all here together alas we could not and then trying to leave with a nightmare someone right in front of the ubirr like it was crazy after that I think I came home and ate pizza and just fell asleep but I was just like I don't know I think I thought just all the emotions and it was just a very big day and it was like amazing how many of you came it was overwhelming when we first open those doors never was such coming and I was like try not to cry oh so overwhelmed all these people have come to the shop which has been put together so quickly and consumed so much time and and so many of you want to come down which is amazing and then yesterday it was really busy you okay there I didn't really blog anything but I had a day here I didn't leave the flat can you not throw I'm probably working out recently you can tell yeah I'm really proud of you Joe so I had a working day here yesterday I had to get loads of things oh no I did not you had chlamydia yesterday can you guys stop and I also had the worst headache all day Joe I've told you a lot of times not scratched and snow is how you smell genuine cat I mean genuine disgusting this morning at me and Alfie went for breakfast without his dad in Balthazar which is really nice we are signing more posters because we just got tot they've sold out stop I'm gonna have to edit all this out please just end this clip I really like wise good I'm really glad you like rice Alfie I'm sure we all really needed to know that so we are currently now I'm not going to so we're currently now all signing posters because the shop just ran out so that is what we're doing right now in whatever he was he's not wearing anything yellow right Joe you've got to sign these ones as well as Alfie so you may as well start and I'm gonna crack open one of these once Alfie comes and helps me because they're so flippin heavy I cannot lift it I found myself thinking min about boyfriend I think we're going a bit delirious we're having a pepper one D probably what's it called Wow oh my god don't ever though we still got you still have to sign that pie off I don't see what 400 more of that yeah come on

painting yeah here get your choice on oh yeah we're gonna get ready we're heading back to the air B&B we actually which was nice because we got to walk through some nice little streets although it's Friday evening and it is so busy and you just end up walking into everyone's farts and there's so many people so far as linger and they weird stick you know the good thing though well I think it's good that it takes longer to drive around London than it does to walk because it encourages you would walk yeah but just then we could have got a taxi that would have taken longer even though don't mean walking and swallowing people's butts"	3798
"no_THE CREATORS CHOICE  THE MICHALAKS.txt"	"if you haven't got problems cause it's a few songs I got 99 problems we have lost our cat which in old we're missing about a week ago we haven't seen him since despite that according in recording and so we're going to campaign to try and find him yes come into the street like down the back and stuff that has really cool like antique shop it's like time job though I think because we're having a bit every project is a moment with the basement where we're going to try and turn the basement into a more family area rather than the dumping program we're going to exclude some secondhand furniture of them like Mike Rugg anything see what we can find so we'll have a little younger you so we are now on the Spanish active apron and we found that really really awesome little steep and beneficial dispensatory in new century stuff and it's really nice they were just trying to like work out what is what you fit in the basement and what goes is what and stuff I feel pretty sure than the days all of the stuff in one shop which is sandy it's very like Don Draper Mad Men the we learn all those beautiful next we have our in kitchen I talk about the kitchen we just found another little antique shop but think for some reason supreme ruler what's up maybe not so much there is such a beautiful mysterious romantic smell to antique shops you can just with this smelt like history you friend look at so many nice little sunbathe isn't he you want to straighten success again we've managed to find a really cool can poison frog I'm Caroline now we just um kick up the rad and wait for the stuff to get livid that rain is going to look so cool now really liked about it Rome route this chorus period heart broken air con in summer with lots of practice wife no canal America I'm sorry Chris good idea okay white Oken or something thank you there's going to be biscuits and tea and I can happy to you there's a massive rug though I'm really enjoying with grunting this okay I really like that front toe GG so like I've met like a monster cabinet base oh not a chance oh that's not racist a ground we should go to speak yeah just do that definitely yes Grayson you asked me to lots of time down every time the answer is yes we are going to Peru and a beat I love you fun chicken you you Grayson and I have been down to his new nursery again and I made a friend of the parent room which is really nice people here are honestly so friendly and it's so refreshing to be like around other adults that are willing to just like ash we swap numbers we should hang it up like it's just so nice okay this review is gonna be very fast and punchy because I'm aware that most people watching us probably have zero interested in electric skateboards so I'm going to very quickly go into it this is the boosted board what you saw me riding up here on I've had it now for about a couple of weeks I think it has been so much fun if our house burned down tomorrow it'll be the first thing I would buy to replace all my stuff it is so much fun it takes snowboarding out of the Alps and it just gives it to me here the feeling you get when you're cruising around on this thing is a kid into what it feels like when you're boarding on it on a beautiful mountain somewhere in France so it's taken a lot of that to the city which is great when you are making new friends it's just a bit weird to kind of get the camera out and start vlogging when you don't really know each other that well and they might not want to be on camera they might not want the kids on camera and like it's just easier just to not do that I don't know how to explain it but yeah I don't want to be this like a weirdo that brings my camera along and is like hey guys listen film with me it goes crazy speeds and when you're going downhill sometimes the brakes just cut out and it happened to me twice two times now I've been bombing it down a hill and the brakes have died and I've had no choice but to literally jump in the air and go into a mid run and land on the concrete and just try and spring two out luckily both times I haven't tripped over the ball has been flying off it's been very dramatic and the fear has just been like nothing else I've known because both hills at the bottom is busy intersections so it's so dangerous if you live anywhere like bath which is covered in hills I would say don't get a boosted board anyway I'm gonna go pick up some food food picnic while Gracie is chilling out and yeah we are going to go head to the park I don't wanna go into any more details about how long it lasts for the battery and like how long it takes to charge all that kind of stuff is loaded up on YouTube about that but I want to give you my quick topline review on it super fun fucking dangerous just pop up outside to talk that again on playdates and typically this has happened I think we're going to have a grandpa Charles we have been trained from our play date for a couple of hours now it was so nice I didn't really blog for these reasons that I said in our earlier but I have a load of washing in the dryer which is all the baby stuff which is really exciting I don't know how you can get excited about washing I never excited about any other type of washing believe me yeah I'm quite looking forward to putting away a little baby burp cloths and towels and things it'll be the only time I ever look forward to doing that because that space that washing in as much fun but it's kind of like all part of getting excited to the baby and stuff so beginning to wash the stuff and my app says I need to pack hospital bag now so please start thinking about that even though I am still I think probably going to go for home birthing option please don't leave me your horror stories in the comments but anyway yeah that's my moment fate my mum chat for you you think you think you are put this on okey dokey today I have had a bit of a day off being a mom I guess because I had a midwife appointment this morning they normally last about an hour or so once I've walked there and back and have my appointment and everything everything's good baby is two fists engaged bit as mum chat here for you I'm going to get my hair done this afternoon because I know that afterwards it will probably be a few months before I get to go again that the last time you just kind of things like that aren't really a priority so the boys have gone for a little like mandate up at the Uni I think they've gone to the brutal this eat the Brutus playground commissioned by the Royal Institute of British Architects I can take your socks off yeah sure and I suppose the only difference is between this brutalist playground and the ones that popped up after the war is this one it's made out of foam and the one back in the day was made out of concrete I'm just gonna go get my haircut and stop Wittering on Bubba yes Daddy thank you for such a lovely day out I know you have a lot of work to do so I really do appreciate you taking the time out to take me out on us on a lovely playdate oh that's okay Grayson don't mention it we really do appreciate it we need to know that I am doing the wrong talk yeah clearly one thing I forgot about being heavily pregnant from last time is that everyone in the street ever look looking in it the problem with that place was it was modeled on these old kind of postwar industrial concrete playgrounds but it was all foam it should have an actual concrete and this is the problem with you guys today you've got too much padding so when you fall over it doesn't matter you're falling want a bit a bit of foam our grandparents and they fell over they found a hard concrete grater you know what I did it taught them not to fall over again I don't know if any of us my old hairdresser and that I wanted to ask him out for a drink so going to knew how to stuff and a little bit like I'm cheating on fan which is y degrees for hate flick this one I'm here now Melissa bitterly I'm only classic you know what does really annoy me though it's when the mum B's go up to something that works there and make them come over and quiz me about why I'm filming a lot of numbers tend to think that everyone fancies their kid for some reason so go for your kids not that attractive if I was into kids which I'm definitely not into kids I wouldn't fancy your kid very much this here is what I'm living on at the moment this is all vegan food we've got chocolate salted caramel ice cream fish fries fish fingers Mexican bean burgers these are pretty bruised we haven't tried these yet but we're going to say this this is a bacon but vegan bacon so no meat in it and look how horrible that looks I'm hoping it tastes a lot nicer than it looks falafels obviously toaster waffles sunflower spread yogurt cheese I haven't actually tried the vegan cheese yet when I first sat down and started doing this but you can diet the funny thing was I was for the first week I was putting much crying into my food because I'm so used to eating meat and dairy that when I was when I first jumped ship and started vegan I was just like this is this is disgusting and I know this like the recipes out there and if I put the time in essay and I probably could have knocked up some delicious stuff but I just went straight into this and bought any vegan stuff in the supermarket I could find in it just made me very depressed but what I will say my expectations for food have adequately adjusted to my new diet so now I don't feel like I'm actually sacrificing anything now I don't like I want to cry into my food anymore now I actually really enjoy this stuff and I never thought I'd say that once you're used to something it's far easier really required by vegan cheese I'm a big cheese fan see what's in this water coconut oil vegan flavor vegan flavor gonna give it a go it's fucking stinks that's brilliant taking a little bit longer to get used to I'm sure the bacon probably cheese I'm imagining this is going to taste like depression let's take bit of fat there I'm quite used to that it smells a bit like United bacon crisps that you use to get I understand what you're trying to do with this but it's not fucking bacon this is just like some sort of label impostor trying to like jump on that neural connection it gets to the end where my brains processing and my brain just like his sauce I'll probably won't buy this again very this in a toasted sandwich with avocado from vegan mayonnaise you probably would know the difference yeah you would you get overly would kind of a difference this is the final week I'm doing this you can diet but I genuinely don't see myself going back to being a dairy and meat eater I think I'm going to continue on this little part of mine I think I'm going to leave it like something subtle I don't know even a dress because I feel once you get sucked into this way of life you create yourself your own analetto chamber and then all you hear is support for it because that's kind of what you engineer and then it turns you into more like a preachy selfrighteous vegan where you just want to enforce your lifestyle on other people I would highly recommend it but that doesn't mean I'm going to tell everyone to do it I just think people should do what's right for them and yeah I had a message on Twitter from a friend of mine I won't say who he is because I have an Austin mission but he basically sent me a message on Twitter saying I paraphrase it's like don't you ever get annoyed as a curator who put so much effort into your work when you see like other Creators who are just throwing out this dross blow up does that ever annoy you because I think that's what he's going through at the moment he's peeing a lot of himself into his videos you need to production and he's trying to push himself and he's not getting in any kind of traction in comparisons when you see all these other youtubers like Jane Paul you know here are Jake pop this is the team ten huh and it is lit every single day right it's like bubble gum throwaway kind of content it's just blowing up and I think what a lot of Graeter's do and what my friend here is doing is they're acquainting then their value as a creator and they're aligning that with her with a metric which is a subscriber count' and if you do that then it's usually nothing depressed because sadly most people like their their their barnum and it's annoying for creators like us when somebody hears about the YouTube anything what I don't check out this YouTube saying what is this blogging thing and they go and look at somebody who has big a load of subscribing oh well we've got to subscribe it means they must be very good and they look at it and they just like without any further ado let's weapons send it today what the fuck is this nonsense fine ethnically scratched our car against the board in the cock cock because iconic Park in a car park apparently and then Gracie and I went to a playgroup but he was just bit but like there and yeah just all got a bit much and I had a bit of mental written on one with our home but now we're in our country Kate and Gracie and I are for like teaching him how to play snakes and ladders and Gracie who won the first game I get you did didn't you yeah I knew in that and who do you thinks gonna win the netsuke I which you play again make the ladders around to when your crater you come to a fork in a road basically every crate will come to this decision at one point and the decision is to go down one road which is great stuff that you know people will like a lot of people will like or you can go the other way where it's great stuff that probably most people won't like but a few people will love and you have to choose where to go what are we doing oh hi there hiding in here why laughs because the crews mama we something like finals come on come on I said it's my friend I said Tony other craters out there makes you decision do you want to go down to popular route and get big just take my word for it that that level of scrutiny would be pretty horrendous or do you just go down to make videos for yourself less is more I'll be rare it will be the Creek business and how many is that one two three four five six oh five and of 650 Buena I didn't want you that I've got hot date with that little bag of hot nut ball I'm allowed to smell them I like the fact that I get to eat the whole bag to myself choose everyone good night Ramona I can't treat that kind of chocolate it's got about inside I know look at this I can't open like let you hold it and show you them because it can't even look it's not the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen I'm still good release do you feel like you're bigger this time you wrote Grayson yeah you're about to pop I don't know if I'm gonna make it for another six weeks but how physically how was I gonna terrified yeah we're going to try and make this quite quick because we have a three and half year old in the room to the outside which makes it extremely difficult sadly didn't hear any news about witchy he's called me yeah we're gonna keep looking our way I defined I got some my fries it's raining he was born and raised in the ghetto it will be muggy mother cats I like good he's one saying about the outro that's why don't make it snappy and Grayson you have to be quiet we're not getting you're not getting any pudding and I want to quickly say before I go I'm gonna show you three things I've got me through so big and so this is sensational I mean it's like a kind of a milky chocolatey drink just tastes absolutely delicious it was nicer than any chocolate cake on had these things which Hannah found Bob these are insanely good at least Oreo Finn's without doping up a deal any good anyway guys thanks for watching see you Oh"	3275
"no_THE HAIR IS BACK.txt"	"hello everybody how's it going I'm in LA yeah get me I've always thought I'm gonna Saturday I'm in LA for like well actually in this side the world poor there is there is it

actually played so many games last night last night thing we played six games you again so Aloha video no you oh cuz I yeah she I was because I didn't want to play him that's like one more woman I'm not oh I just wanted to bed oh he inject like them that is true yeah because we ended up going to bed about 12 and managed to sleep front i woke up at seven so that's pretty good for your first day in LA we need to like go and do food shopping and bara so we're going to go and grab breakfast first do a food shop and it also got lunch with a friend called brent as well is already realized he's made a mistake i'm looking at the English he just needs so in LA one thing i remember in june miss a single june gloom which means i don't know a guest of the light pollution and stuff which every the whole of june so up until midday 12 o'clock it's not very sunny so it's very cloudy and grey and looks a bit like England that she and i look at the Weber and it's going to clear up later but right now it's not so I'm just wearing jeans and then Matt was in shorts and here's like look time I was like you look very English map no you should have that you've really shouldn't there is looking a lot less English oak so yeah look at this slope I'll give you guys tour later but you walk straight in the door there's a lovely little sofa bed that is what i mean by June gloom you look up and you're

we're like oh hello's cool yes yeah well I hope it will get sunny for your sake yeah because I started it doesn't want to get tatted but this is the whip by the way look at that whip it's really annoying in America well first of all with parking on the road you got to be really careful because they always do a street cleaning and stuff so you've got to make sure that you can park where you parked yeah it's really known as well when we went to pick the car up I prebooked it and because you're under 25 which makes no sense me that you can't really get like any card that's the only color you can get me that's the biggest that's for video start you can get unless you're over 25 but I don't get it it's like in America from nerds drivers 16 gone yet why they funny with us when we come over and drive food has come and I couldn't decide by one so I went to one like a smaller version so what's ain't called protein scramble eggs chicken broccoli asparagus also gone almond pancake on the side which I've had these here before it's amazing would you get mad yeah but tell them I I did explain how to practice your essays you like oh yeah Ross I was like you know Madison toy box that

weekly vlog for you like actually a weekly vlog like Monday Friday a couple of snippets of my day and just show you what I got to this week it should be quite patch one it's actually the Monday after Lily's hen so that is why I sound like a sound that's my look like how I look it was a great weekend but it featured very little amounts of sleep so yeah this Monday morning has been a bit of a tough one I've got one of those Monday mornings when it's just like annoying Erin D adulting things to do it before I kind of like get on with my day I don't want to tell you what the time is because let's just say I did have a bit of a line I don't normally do that but it was very much required I didn't get back to quite late last night and I was in bed at like 9:00 p.m. and but one of the first things out to do is all of this stuff here this is all stuff for summer haul that you guys would have seen on Sunday but I want to take a couple of cutaways and put it on my body hopefully managing to cover up the bits but I actually got sunburned this weekend what full what kind of fool gets sunburned I've got like a criss cross on my back from a sports bra what an idiot my face is so pale compared to my body I definitely need to put some Clarins on this it's basically not going to be the most exciting day on fire but you know balance and all that can handle my heart say that I have never been so not up for the gym so like I get the best deal with dinner I get to make it and then mark this restaurant I give up I'm better at doing the dishwasher to be fair he is my favorite retreated into my spatial awareness just isn't great this is why can't park the car Ariza fucking said chauvelin you profitable thanks getting better good morning morning I've been up since that car five because I just like to have a bit of time to like back in the morning I don't like to be rushed there's a train strike today so getting up there could be a little bit problematic hence what I mean so ridiculously early but today I'm meeting up with Lilly this morning we're doing a job one of our favorite brands and then I'm going to meet Santa from Santa Van Dyke she's like my fitness crush girl crush go boss crush I just absolutely love her and we're going to work out together I have never done a proper workout with there we did a video for active in style I'll link that down below that was so fun but

my size on a sauce and they're so nice I really like them they feel very comfortable but I thought my best advice is just in case Simon Says face and say hey I'm going to do like session and I'm gonna die yeah he's gonna die miss awesome and everything take no wait listed thank you so nice medium crackitus taking about two and half hours to get home walked home with my bags quite a long walk quite painful the type of leg session and I didn't actually vlog this but went to Whole Foods never go to Whole Foods within this blogger it's just dangerous there's so many things and of like we try this we tried this is like all know what happened in the basket when it was very dangerous but I look forward to eating all those I look forward to dinner and I see you had been there this morning in the shower and the shower kind of longed to be bit just came off soaked in my showers so the poor guy had to just like splash himself with the taps like kneeling down in the bath so we need to laugh later

"no_The Most Incredible Office EVER"	"good morning so it's a Tuesday off the bank holiday weekend everybody is heading back to work today myself included I've got a day full of meetings today I'm in central London and I totally forgot how awkward it is logging in public I just tried to find a bit of a quiet street for blog but yeah so I've got a busy days of meetings today which I'll take you guys along first stop is Aveda trying to remember which direction has been the I'm meeting I've got a breakfast meeting first and then I'm going my nails done with and loving that from a Bader so really nice starts today so that's again okay so I'm two meetings down I've had my nails done at evader they look so lovely I had a good old chat Ignatz the PR while we had our nails done and went through a few new products which I'll show you guys later now I'm in the personal shopping suite at coast on Oxford Street and I'm going to pick out a few pieces from the new collection because I'm going to be doing some shoots for their new Friday collection some of your lovely space going to do some trying on and I'll show you some beautiful so a few hours has now passed since our last vlog that I went to see the lovely coast store and picked up the key pieces is going to the road to the hot walk and talk picked up a few nice pieces to shoot I showed you a few of them in the camera then I went and had but I'm compiling this and work now heading to Berkeley Square and we're going to go to a an event with this L is actually a bridal event so if they know something I don't come but it's all about like skincare the big day and we're going to meet Abigail James who actually had a facial with a little while ago I think I also call so you guys know how much I love this so really looking forward going an afternoon with a brand and we're nearly there I'm bang on time let's go so that was a really lovely event with liz'll I tried to show you a few clips but basically we had one of the brand ambassadors showing us the best techniques for applying your cleanse and polish which I actually show you guys the last night but really lovely to learn the best ways and how it can really benefit us in like getting rid of under eye bags things like that I don't have any makeup on now because we obviously took it off with our friends and polish hello again so it's a couple of hours later I just went to the fabulous miss el Bridal masterclass and we had a bit of a skincare lesson on how to really properly apply your cleanse and polish hence the no makeup and all about massage techniques for getting rid of puffiness off your eyes etc so many useful tips I'm deafening an exam on a blog very soon I think a lot of people my Instagram stories are going crazy because I saw the word Bridal no it is not happening just yet but it was more like big day makeup I'm now in the cellar basement of how the phrase on Oxford Street and I'm about to a pedicure hard live today not every day is this nice but it's a nice way to end the day I'm going to get a male's ink gel pedicure down in the little downstairs treatment room did not know this was here bit of a surprise um so yeah I'm looking forward to just reading a magazine at for 40 minutes or so getting my toes done and my nails earlier and then of course how many emails I need to do when I get home so it's going to be a evening of work but for now I'm going to take 40 minutes to chill out if you like today's vlog has made the day in the life of a blogger look really glamorous and fun not every day is like this most days involved lot of admin crouched over my laptop as you guys will see you throughout the rest of May but this is a very good standard life from blogger back home again now and immediately just put on my most snugly hoodie so much echo going on in here because obviously it's an empty room not going to lie a little bit disappointed to come home and find that the builders seem to have spent like a grand total of one hour here today and there seem to be maybe five extra tiles in the bathroom and that's about it Charlie was here all day and he said that only one person turned up at like 2:00 o'clock so not best start to us getting back and seeing them working and apparently there's some mess up with the glass of the windows so who knows what's going on there and but yeah so once again we are refined to just our bedroom in the middle ball space I am actually looking at a few options for staying in a hotel for a couple of nights because not really very livable here at the moment especially cuz you've got so much work to do charlie spend the whole day working out Abigail's cafe nearby not ideal and there's something up with our WiFi as well so I'm trying to upload yesterday's vlog but it's currently saying seven hours so this rate is not going to be up until after midnight but yeah fingers crossed things will start turning around soon but yeah so I think the last time I spoke to you as well underground at House of Fraser they have this little underground pamper room I have my toes done by nail think they're a really nice color I'll show you them in a second I can't miss my neck up high enough to show you now but they did it in a way that I've not have done before where you can choose any of the nails ink colors from their entire normal nail varnish collection which is just ginormous and then they mixed it with a gel a clear gel so you can literally choose any color in the whole world and turn into a gel so that was nice took about 40 minutes nice and quick and then I sat on the bus use my personal hotspot and got a load of emails done sometimes and now I'm home I'm going to try to spread out some of the bits and bobs I picked up today which I will show you now okay so this is not how I normally do my blog mail sat on the floor with a ladder behind me but that's what we're going to go with today so I have my bag from coast where I went in and I think I actually showed you guys me try on a few outfits so I just have those in here I'm going to quickly show you them anyway first of all that there is this really beautiful navy of the shoulder top and in like a denim but it's got a lot of boning in the material here so when it's on it has a really 3d ruffle effect which I thought was really pretty really nice with a pair of white jeans with some wedges very kind of friendship south of France style v such as oh it's lovely and then this is a pink lacy on the jacket and if you guys know coast and it's mostly kind of known for bridesmaids dresses this is really fun casual very kind of weekend brunching style and capsule collection for them so this is a beautiful color which as you know I just love this is the same material as the first top that I showed you but it's actually a jumpsuit I know insert both of it from the website here because it really doesn't do it justice showing you in like this but again that reboots all almost any material I'm trying really hard not only wear white and pink so this is me trying to branch out with some darker colors this top I did show you me trying dis on and I think I'm going to get a lot of wear of this in some really very chic kind of tops with a blue and white stripes you've got this Peter Pan kind of collar six straps and a really flattering it's high waist and then I got two pairs of trousers so I've never tried any trousers from coast people but these are their jeans but they have loads of elasticity so incredibly comfortable they fit really nicely and I got them in white and then a gray color but this is a gray that almost pink in certain lights so really really pretty and even 79 pounds and probably most comfortable jeans I think I've ever tried so really looking forward to wearing my new bits from coast I'll leave all of them linked down below just in case you want to check them out I know it's hard to imagine without me properly try mom but they'll be down there anyway and then the nizzle bridal skincare masterclass we got a little goodie bag from the master class inside as always there is a press release I think this is probably just going to be about the cleanse and polish yeah so this is all about the cleanse and polish ritual which is the best way to apply the cleanse and polish all about the different ingredients sustainably caught sustainably sourced cocoa butter eucalyptus oil rosemary oil etc and then I have my lovely little box and this was waiting for me on the table at the event so those beautiful pink peonies all over the table very photogenic and then every blogger has a little vanity case in the middle turquoise color got marble and little mirror inside and then here is our cleansing kit so we all have personalized headbands which we wore while we're doing the massage techniques this is the Liz Earle skin Repair moisturizer which I don't think I've tried this one before I tried the one in the tube but my skin still feels really lovely and soft it's the last thing I put on after the cleansing ritual I've also got the gentle face exfoliator the eye bright soothing eye notion which is really soothing but also gets rid of eye makeup so love this one I have a travel version of this which was so good taking with me on holiday and finally the super skin lip balm which I mentioned in my new in April Beauty launches video so interview I deserve and this gorgeous little pouch as well which is just so handy to keep my bit from both in so I'm going to pack all these bits away and then I think Charlie and I are going to make dinner chicken wrapped in bacon or something and then I guess another early night because I was certain not much you can do in the house so I'll catch you guys okay it's been a couple of hours since I last spoke to you guys I've been trying to battle with the WiFi but it's not working so there's no vlogs going up tonight so you guys would have seen the first of May vlog on second or third of me I don't know basically we're a day behind but what I'm going to do is in a second I'm going to cut to tomorrow because for me tomorrow daytime I'm doing something which I can't really film so instead of just not having a vlog tomorrow I'm going to make everything a day late because of the WiFi glitch and I'm going to learn from this mistake and in the future I'm going to edit before bed and get them uploading overnight I think not something most people do when they do daily vlogs I like to get up early in the morning and then get it uploading throughout the day but that's just not working out so that's what's going to happen so I'm going to say goodnight to you for now and the next thing you're going to see is what I'm doing on Wednesday night yeah so see you in the future so just picking up where I left off the video yesterday I'm asking Manchester at the moment and just works on a really cool project now I'm in ways potentially the world's coolest office first of all we have three dogs charging around one of whom I have formed totally in love where that might feel like Dexter would have a major envy and jealousy if you saw how much I've been kissing little Simba but also where I am at the moment is like little sleeping hot apparently they're not allowed to sleep in languages out because I'm consuming it God's design kits and everything that no one telling me I can't have a nap they've even got a slide around the corner a living wall this little gnome and a tree inside basically I wish I worked back in London now and I found Charlotte we come to the new Sparkle which is a key in logging so I've only live in someone in my back thinking the same thing just here it's London and channel can do mr. sparkles art art or how I think the gym as well Charlie port is basically going to be an active but I have but this is a really big you yo actually not sure which room we interchange from reason yeah we can move how is your sparkle coming out was I knew it was going to become first blood I don't think he gave me that I probably struggled the most out of everyone in the room I mean I have been skimmers however like the exercises she push you know when you've reached that point where you're like I can't push me harder than she's like 10 no your body just starts going like quivering when we were doing the app think my abs were like chattering I found that was easiest the legs and the bumps to me were but we were saying we might I'd like to do that once a week you realize so many around London maybe with Kelsey one so yeah we just in our barkal class very quick turnaround in the changing room and now we are on our way to an event with Nespresso and this is a secret circle club event we don't really know too much about it but we've got to say a secret code when you get to the door I think the knowledge in some new coffee flavors I know they are no they are because they've got these combinations flavors it's like them and also they really hashtag not fun and they've also release which I thought was quite clever idea like aged coffee which is like going to be the new thing so the capsules are like 2 years aged it's like wine or whiskey legend aged coffee did not know that was a thing so anyway we all let you guys know member there and show you what's Karen excuse the shocking lighting situation at the moment but Charlie and I are

it can you see it doodles yeah and I was driving and I heard a bang I've got puppy bang weird sounds like what and then my car started making its like rule sound and I was nearly hurt him so I put my hands on a star everybody slowly but as I got into where near where I live the car was like chugging and I had to have a hassle and I ma'am if it had been any longer I wouldn't have got home but let me show you what's happened so clearly my tire has just broken like how has that happened I don't understand what's happened but that was really really frightening I didn't like that at all so it's

glory shall we oh my god so beautiful and then in here I have stored all of my candles all of my candles I specifically want this one the maple praline praline so weirdly I'm feeling more shook up now about the car things than I did like when it happened I think when it happened I was just like just get the car home or get yourself home fortunately it happened on a jewel carriageway that was at the turnoff for my house and my house is right next to that so I in the back of my mind it's like I'm so close to even if I broke down like physically right here where these happen like where's a bang happen then so my comedy bang what lights lighting this is I look so delicious and the car made a bang I was like what was that noise that I've run over a balloon what's that and it was just a bit like what and I knew that even who had stopped that we could have walked home because we were so close and I did feel a bit panicked is my door locked yes it is felt really panicked especially because I had Darcy in the car and like the other baby technically in the car with in the belly I'm carrying up my laptop my blanket he's saying yes I'm I'll have it snugly my phone in a giant candle and those kittens running around my feet um I'm really waffling now I think I'm in like sense of weird shock but I didn't like it I feel really shook up what do you think rocket rocky these are your

"no_The vlogs are back.txt"	"good morning beautiful humans I'm back at it with the vlogs ie took a break for a while just because I wasn't feeling like vlogging you just have to feel feel it I was not feeling it I just went to hot yoga for the first time it was said it like 95 degrees holy moly it was hard but the reason I loved it was because it was more focused on meditation and strength than like I took one that was like more with weights and I didn't like that because I already weight trained so I don't need to like I like when I go to yoga I want to actually be in like a peaceful state and still have like a push but not like all push does this make sense long story short I really liked that yoga class and I'll be going back the instructor was so great she really helped with breathing techniques and posture and she was talking a lot about contentment which I struggle with so that was really helpful and she was also talking about letting go and have some people you know tend to stay in the moment and have a hard time accepting and then releasing and moving on and some people can easily just kind of let things go I'm like on the border I like can let things go and then sometimes I don't so I'm constantly working on myself and my arm hurts so as you can tell the hot yoga class was really hot because my whole bra is soaking wet and sweat um but yeah but now I'm

night but notable makeup mentions today this the result time multi corrective CC cream in natural loving it which is feeling quite a light base today so I just use this with a bit of the bourgeois healthy balance powder over the top which I really like and then on my lips is the Maybelline Color sensational shine gloss in the shade glorious grapefruit which I just put on and then Pat it down that's how I like to wear my gloss and then a quick outfit of the day it's a bit cloudy outside right now but I've checked the weather and it's going to be a bit of a scorcher so I've gone for a legs

up so tonight's dinner is going to be nice and quick and easy there you go tada no these are not all butter they're actually yeah this one is meatballs I think it could be meatball sauce I think it's

sir had to do the last minute but just picked up these nude shoes because they were on the model with a dress I bought and they look very nice and within the sale this bag to go with it I quite liked the neon detailing on the top adds a bit of color and then this is the dress I got and I bought it in two sizes because I wasn't sure what one eye would be and this is what it looks like it's quite high on the neck and then it comes to just above the knee and now I think I'm going to pack because we're about to leave in an hour or so and I'm loving you see a suitcase Pat rounded right today me

"no_THIS COULD BE OUR LAST TIME  THE MICHALAKS.txt"	"we're talking about youtubers and myself a nation with youtubers I freely admit I'm quite old actually to get into this powerful energy it is an art form the way I got into it was by following a family who make absolutely stunning and film about their life and they just popped me in and it is Steph his wife Hannah and their little son Grayson so I've been watching it for so long I've actually seen little coastal growing up and I felt up I knew their flag I knew every inch I'm you know daily routine it was really weird if they would have hooked me in they film or everything about their lives and it's quite generous because we the anonymous viewers get to see how they live and as I say it for me and they're done with themselves nobody's helped them certain some of them self and see of their life playing out how to get people or an awful they realize you we have you guys are amazing and toes my life now this is a lot I just thought I'd make this short thing and today is I'm going to call cool Toby see how he's like basically honestly like I saw a couple of them Instagram stories that he did and he's like he's a different kid like he's a different guy meaning like compared to how we first saw it now he's just I got this new YouTube like I'm so happy for it what about you match them video online enemy film yeah you in the filming mood to be honest I would quite like to get into that election that's next I might try and do that tomorrow kind of so hard his even activities in photography I feel like I'm not using my kind one enough can I give you a my a random fact about Netflix but they actually run a little massive loss they're like goober they were billions loss they must be big as I do but they are massively like running a deficit so so alike all these big companies you see everything's winter they've run out a massive loss excuse loss like we're talking billions even a thoughts that we do make all plums calling hey mom step you made spring/summer it is such a technophobe all right all right I really tell you a little story when I was back 13 my mum that my sister and I all moved to Ireland and we lived in this tiny remote little village it had a population of about 800 803 when my mum and my sister and I arrived it had one tiny shop at church and about 300 pubs Irish people tend to like to drink quite a lot that's not me being a racist saying that that's a fact Irish just do tend to drink quite a lot so many of you lift hard snow flakes again offended by that go to Ireland and you'll see for yourself they drink a lot out there a lot as you say this somehow fire if someone had to say this stuff but you can't say it if you're not half Irish anyway the place we lived was somewhere called round wood and it was in the middle of the Wicklow Mountains there was absolutely nothing for me to do there the only thing I did was set fire to things that was about it and then one day a friend of mine from England came over one of my childhood friends called car they came over with his family and Carl brought with him a bunch of CDs of bands that he was listening to he spilled them out on my floor in my bedroom and there was two particular bands that when it would end up affecting pretty much some god to fit the rest of my life those two bands were Nirvana and untold jungho Jam the album 10 is still to this day probably my favorite album this is my birth pool which I'm planning on having baby Mitchell at number 2 in down here I have a hose that is going to be connected to obviously the tap upstairs and we just need to set up like a little table and chairs for the midwives as like some snaps and things on and get like an area where and they can check the baby afterwards and stuff and I have a box here that has all of my life stuff ready to go so I've got like plastic sheeting for the floor away I've got puppy pads I've got an old shower pattern as what I find attachment we've got birthing ball bin bags v torch mirror towels for me how's the baby changing mat so all I need to do now is basically to bring mine and the babies hospital bags down here so it's got clothes to put on afterwards but ya can't reduce me to grunge music and what grunge music did is it reached into all this teenage angst and this frustration and this isolation I suppose I felt and it kind of made it feel a little bit more acceptable a bit more habitual it just made it not seem like I was the only kid going through this crap I think when you're younger you're trying to find yourself you go through all kinds of crap in your head this new grunge music was just a way for me to channel all of this channel this shit I was dealing with through I suppose I'm really really really really hoping that it will work felt the way I want and we get to do at home I was so lucky with my birth with Grayson like it literally went exactly to my birth plan the music affected me so much that it just made me want to be in musician I was like I want to do this I want to affect people with the way this music affects me I feel like with Grayson I went into panic mode a little bit because I didn't know what anything was and I was just oh my god this is it and I kind of like tensed up a bit whereas this time I feel way more in the position to be like it's happening if today we're going to meet a baby this is going to be an amazing day and just kind of hopefully go with it a bit more rather than freaking out but yeah I started to shave the birthing room the nearest guitar shop to us was in someone called brave 40 minutes one hour's drive from us and one day we went to Bray and I was like a camera diving as guitar shop and see what's going on and I remember walking in so clearly to this guitar shop and walked right to the end of the row of the guitar and just at the end I saw something that just I don't know if you've ever wanted something so much or felt so much desire for something that you almost become breathless when you see it it was like that it was like I saw this thing that I was just little just like completely took my breath away that this is the most single most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life it was this guitar that made all the other guitars look like rotting contorted pieces of wood once I saw this thing I was just like I just felt so deeply in love with it and I I need to have this so I flipped over the little thing to see how much it was the little price taxi how much it was it was about 140 Irish pounds at the time and that was just like way beyond what I could imagine ever affording we were poor so like there's no way that was going to happen but when you really run something you don't let anything get in the way of that thing so I rocked up to the manager the guitar shop and I said what deposit who had to put down on this in order to to keep anyone from buying it so I can try and find this money somehow and he's like I do it my Irish accent because it was an incredible Irish accent anyone who's Irish watching so this isn't very good you were the one with the problem not me and he was like hey keep it free up for a mug and it didn't get me to volume or finish yes for the next month I scrubbed toilets in an Irish pub I lifted cigarette butts out of the Rhinos I was getting paid obviously it wasn't just because I wanted to I went when people's houses and asked if I could clean their cars for a couple of quid I sold anything I had I could at schools and eventually I got enough money to go and buy this guitar and just at the end of the month oh I rocked up to the guitar shop and I spilled out all these coins and notes and he handed me this my first guitar it is the cheapest spender that you can buy it's a Fender Squier it's super cheap but to me it's the most valuable item I own I've had a really productive day actually I've managed to film two videos on my channel I might film another one or I might just not I'm tired now I feel like the third trimester takes it out of you carbonation pretty easily so I'm going to go and do some editing now but I thought you might like to see that a few years ago I decided to kill it out with some like new pickups in a new bridge it's something that's going to be with me for the rest of my life there comes a time when you just come to terms with the fact you never going to be a rock star like it's just not going to happen and then I kind of think I just stopped hanging that but I'm not going to rock star I'm going to put it on the back burner and just focus and other stuff but I think I've come to terms with it now properly and I'm like well it doesn't matter who cares I'm not be a rock star can still play lead guitarist and enjoy playing it so I'm going to start playing again using it anyway a friend of mine called Ned he actually works with fender and he was like we've got this app which teaches you how to play the guitar like so you can just basically like put it on your phone play along I think having a guitar teacher is really good school spend a play and I've been using it every day for the past like 10 days just playing it on with it I'm going to go and see s of the country blast king somewhere for me and it's not I'm going to make stuff going going so yes I've got everything I need now I just need to start practicing and dusting off the skills and then I'll start scoring the videos I think it'd be nice to have some kind of stuff that I've written myself in the videos I need to get good enough first this could take me some time but yeah anyways wanted to show you my love yeah banana so be how are you good I just been rehearsing with the band how's that working out I'm going to good mood let's go well actually yeah yeah good to be open to play guitar from there and it took some pretty nice target house them as a last week me it's been amazing like oh it has I mean like that first day when everything started coming English is mental if you expand in me like that not at all I started reading all the comments the middle all display so like how much did you make in total I think made like seven thousand pounds in the end the Chechen grandad knows that's like more than enough to get you kind of up and running isn't it now really yeah where I walked into this vacation I was just like I can pay off my debt now and I saw one of my songs Thank You doke so much for me that's because you literally I'll change my life I just have a bit more like selfworth now you like we've won the lottery and your hand baked the appalling time we're releasing be doubly happy for you thank you we can see ya don't lose the pain in the angst oh you need that the music forget you come from speaking today to take write

million possible verb just arrived at our house including our so far some stuff from China tomorrow's good day good stuff and went to the doctors about my hair then as I mentioned it probably didn't mention it yesterday but basically and I hate talking about this because yeah actually this to be real basically I in like the last two and like actually so I developed this like I can little my scalp was really itchy and then I developed this lightly little patch right here on my head I'm not really just look so crusty and then it's just been growing and now it's like on my whole hairline and I said I feel like it right started form stress is kind of like psoriasis and then basically we're kind of itch too like I lost my hair there and I've got like a a patch like not that big but about that big here that if you said I'm not going bald it's fine it's just up scratching and look as you can see I just want to keep pitching my hairline and you can see like a good dot perch here and a dot

"no_This Won't Stop Us  Vlog Ep.4.txt"	"good morning everybody what's happening what's going on welcome to Namibia we are on a farm surrounded by land rovers Humber is currently being fixed it's early in the morning my Sunday these guys are getting stuck in under the bonnet yesterday we had a problem where while the engine cuts out and yeah I'm fearing the worst guys opened up this often one of the bolts holding down tappet cutter sheared out oil coming out everywhere turns out the rocker shaft is split in half and there was talks of the cylinder head being warped which would be a huge job to replace luckily they have everything here so yeah we're just feeling very lucky actually and secretly guys I'm quite happy this has happened because we are in the most beautiful place and these guys are amazing I would never have met all of these people amaura baby are you hmm Kenan a lot more a lot like today yeah yeah we did have we are here sure plus it also they're also the most loveliest ham yeah lovely people hospitality being unreal take a guess about how many I don't know by the way I've encountered how many Land Rovers their arm is problem yeah it has to have that score tonight okay yeah if it has to have wheels on it that rule yeah yeah I'm going to count them we could be here for a couple of days which actually have no problem with at all but also I've been messaging Andrea I'm sending in pictures of all the old Land Rovers and he is so jealous I he's seriously considering driving from jo'burg just to come and join in the fun okay so he found that the the cylinder head has got some problems I'm not going to go into detail because I don't really fully understand but basically it's been skimmed once before badly and it's also got a crack in it so we're not 100% happy so we're going to replace it because it's a brand new cylinder head on brick parts after that everything's going to be letter yeah I got to admit though this is slightly disconcerting I'm learning so much learning so much also I love I love how confident these guys are I mean they've done this 1, 274 times but I'm not worried at all maybe I should be maybe that's my problems maybe I should be more concerned about things but down okay kakie three okay okay you some song yeah you got it it seems like there's a lot of engine parts cleaning going on and I'm busy doing some work can be like a brandnew brandnew car taking this time to catch up on some editing Nicole is on a Landrover somewhere on the farm this huge farm being shown around I think we might be here another night maybe two nights but this is Randy my work in the kitchen check out these photos I took yesterday of Humber when she was still running actually that was two days ago I took these with the two hundred four hundred millimeter from Canon pretty stoked with them about how is it all four by four expeditions yeah goes away for a while yeah this one is massive cleanup song to get entirely complacently get this look away this will pop when you got the time is for Twitter these guys have done so much work I can't believe what they've achieved in one day these are the two magicians or three magicians I've been working on them on the Pumbaa and look at this new rocker shaft ran in the head and brandnew radiator with bigger pipes which will help cooling in much hotter conditions ie tropical conditions up in Kenya so we should have zero problems with overheating great news top banana I'm uploading a video called why I quit blogging which a little bit clickbait key sort of but not really because I haven't clicked haven't actually quit blogging but I did for a bit it's an explainer video you guys have most certainly seen it by now but it feels good to talk about it all and I think I maybe had a little bit too much of a rant it's quite long but whatever it's done and I needed to get it off my chest feeling good about that not feeling so good about the speed of the internet but at least there is some internet and we have a whole nother night here because they are they did so much work improvement today I can't believe how quickly they're working and I'm very very excited for tomorrow when hopefully the finishing touches and we've got on the car and we can actually crack on with our journey having only been delayed by a couple of days incredible considering the cylinder head was replaced very very lucky anyway we're going to learn how to do this all ourselves one day and I certainly have learned a lot today but tomorrow we're going to crack on I'll see you then we go Oh okay update update update we've now been here two days and we are so close to being finished engine we just took it for a test in and the engine is super strong way more like quite a lot more power than before loads of works been done to the car and right now they're just changing a few bits on the suspension and the steering area and just to make sure that they're not going to give us any cut that we just had a nice little drone flight around the farm Cole's first drone flight how was it fun yeah I'd like to take it yeah it becomes really like second nature so looking forward to getting out of here and getting back on the road though we have very much enjoying our state with your hands Strauss and family yeah absolutely fascinating place and and how lucky we are that we broke down so close to your hand and his workshop cooled us he's been the chief mechanic working on the car he is so meticulous it just kind of want to take him back to Cape Town with me and set up a proper mechanic shop one that doesn't slip and skip out on important things I'm not going to go into into detail but there's some safety things that have been horribly overlooked by mechanics in Cape Town that could have left us on occasion with no brakes yeah not particularly impressed with that but luckily your hands cousin lives in Cape Town and he also is into Land Rovers so I'm going to be getting in touch with him for future servicing etc yeah what a crazy adventure so far super looking forward to exploring the rest of Namibia well they were going to have to skip out a couple of bits on this expedition now due to losing a couple of days okay guys Pumbaa is ready is the evening it's taken in two days to fix the car up and we're finally ready to crack on with our adventure well I just want to say thank you so much pleasure yeah yeah I hope you have nope no problem for the corrosion which is this is you guys are my two new favorite people well sir you surely will come visit but with our wheels that work okay yeah I know that why do we go oh you find out I know master we have just left sign Fontaine's no sign of I'm sure I know this saying is very appreciated where everything happens for a reason but couldn't believe that saying okay any more than I do now I was so upset when this all happened at the time yeah feeling good about the car you heard about the trip ahead I'm with those people

"no_TO BE CONTINUED...  THE MICHALAKS.txt"	"we're going to be an enjoyable birth partner given the card start to the week isn't it in a graveyard what I'm really peaceful that'll be nice day to come it's a graveyard because we're like we're about to give birth to a new life and this is a sort of resting place for all these lives at once live it's like that whole cycle isn't it and we have to go for a walk somewhere yeah this is crazy dude how many people work the amount of people who have ever lived no I do not know I do oh did you research this research there 107 million Wow in mana theory another list all these gravestones represent all these people any ones were somebody's kids find it really interesting like I kind of want to know who they were what they did and like it's really frustrating the econ me you could probably find out but not really you might get some like buried in some libraries and book somewhere there's something like a carpenter or something but like wouldn't be better to know what yeah but they were like I want to know more about them with people at individuals there's what his gravestone like actually go just going around and seeing the name yeah it's really markets and names right now you're gonna go this week okay no it's really hard to like it's one of those things you can't forget I'm so good if you to go you wanna see so you've been pregnant for educators yeah everyone keep saying that's a great thing to hear when you're like I just want to have the day we now people are like are you sure about having twins ha ha ha and I'm like her silently just wanting prefer inside so I won't offer you yeah we feel a bit like wearing this kind of weird limbo stage at the moment like we've got this cloud of uncertainty that's sort of hanging over us and it's incredibly distracting from these videos so intrinsically connected to our emotions the same time it doesn't accept excuses like you can't make excuses because all it does is just as right if you feel disconnected and if you feel like the camera's heavy and the editor battles and you feel this way then that's what you need to paint you need to find inspiration from the very cloud of uncertainty that you're in yeah it's just it's all it's on our mind right now with completely and utterly distracted by the fact we're about to have another baby anyway in a few days we'll meet him or her and then hopefully the cloud blow away so finally think about doing this for a job as it really forces you to to be very introspective and look inside yourself and see what's troubling you and once what you're finding difficult and hard and it makes you face your battles that's what I find interesting about this job the fact is that we try to let it be conducted by emotions so what we produce has has to come from the heart yeah because I mean I must admit when you first said your wonderful grace and grace at this time we didn't liked it yeah no I was a bit like blah and then my sister said oh is he called after grace and parry the sculpture and I said yes absolutely if I had to clearly Grayson Perry was intronic model very good well I had to look him up and I found okay summer taking a gap year gone to

"no_TOTAL DISASTER  Vlog S2E3.txt"	"good morning everybody what's happening what's going on welcome to namibia stay five of our expedition and we're about to leave this campsite which is called klein alse vista beautiful campsite we are heading where we going up sources play oh yeah that's gonna be the best bit one of the best bits yesterday we went to an abandoned mining town it's like a ghost town roll clips of the ghost town some of the buildings could be unsafe welcome to Coleman's cop and abandoned town in Namibia we let this place go hey that's what my channel looks like abandoned love exploring with Josh exploring with Josh would love this main new bar yeah absolutely one previous owner the sand has just crept into every single room there to me is the most pointless and stupid thing ever let's just write your name and the date like permanently on a place is just backwards now why would you do that not super confident in the structural integrity of this sketchy get gar so much sand have come in here just stupid to get through the doorways which is unusual for me I'm pretty put for a full board if we call to see a snapshot of how this community was back back in the day gymnastics club of course yeah that's my am some now attacked attacks in Africa by commerce top of your part is true definitely going to check it out yeah what's in sauces later silently is if you google movie earth the images of slices today will probably pop up there so this is sandy huge red rolling you just took us minutes to pack up it's not too bad ready to get all wash bag and the soap you skip it in there okay alright let's go shall we sexy in that beanie girl first time every time there were three we have a major major issue potentially fatal for the car yeah could you tell us back yeah that would be amazing yeah I get the tow rope I'm really hoping that the bolts that hold the cover in aren't sheared because that's a huge job we might be stuck here luckily we didn't get that far I don't know if guys okay these two lovely ladies are going to tell us back to house luckily is only a few kilometers and you know I'm fearing the worst guys I feel like that bolt has sheared off just like previously that bolt sheared off yeah hopefully out such a good mechanic okay we made it to house we were towed thank you tears by the nicest ladies and now I guess we have to make a plan feeling a little bit heartbroken right now you hate me then okay two minutes two minutes I've been here and this this man isn't helping us you're on you feeling optimistic about this yeah just I put way too much oil in basically yeah you will see the difference well it's not screwing back in nicely that means it's not shared too much oh is that a problem no that shouldn't be but it just I don't know what I just want kind of fun with it now for did you dropped a few pudding move how we've driven we drove from Rosh Pina we put in the oil yeah a couple of thousand Kay's don't know no that's not you something else think so so it's happened before with this bolt here and it's been shared no as you know the amount of oil okay so that makes me feel a little bit better definitely I put too much oil in so it's got too much oil in but I mean that's not why were juggling it shorted out of the space again out of that then we're trying to get hold of a guy called Johann Strauss here is the only Land Rover mechanic in Namibia and luckily for us is he's any sort of 270 k's in here hello yeah again Land Rover troubles yeah I've got an old Land Rover yeah I love but Land Rovers it's all part of the journey as well you want to do is get the sauces play and enjoy the dunes but at least we're not like in some random sand dune or something somewhere where nobody can come help us okay we are on our way well you're a year receipt Anya no no no I said everything okay hit the road nearly there you need that number we have arrived for hours pretty great no problem now it looks like we can get a whole new Xander if we wanted we are in the middle of nowhere let them go hello hello okay thank you very good yeah yeah black Ben Ben hey Irina Nicole okay 1990 fish the media thank you for um yeah helping us are you feeling that lifestyle right now I'm like like madness it was on high but I know in a couple weeks or when this is fixed I look back in drag another part of the trip remember right not like this is terrible yeah it's amazing it's beautiful around here the drive here was incredible we've backtracked every I'm very obviously going to be staying overnight and the mechanic Corbis will be working on the car first thing in the morning and I will be watching him and learning there's a lot of stuff I know about this card I didn't used to know about that there's also a lot of stuff that I still need to learn cording to these guides and Andrea and all sources this was the fault of the previous mechanics that worked on the car seven Landy's who over tightened the tappets cover bolts second time they've done that yeah seven Landy's also did a cut job on Nicole's dad's car Tony's car and then charged him loads to fix the problem that they created and this is a neat are now look it was a discovery three anyway onwards and upwards such as life we just had such a nice place books for tonight and tomorrow night which we're going to have to push back hopefully where are we going to stay so this way yeah with wilderness but it's not just pushing that back I forgot the three places worked after that yeah okay your hand and his wife have let us set out and rooftop tent up right outside where we're going to be working on the car tomorrow so we're just going to camp up tomorrow we're going to be fixing the car pretty much I think all day and bestcase scenarios we leave tomorrow worstcase scenarios it takes two days if I'm honest I'm quite happy to spend a little bit more time just making sure Humber is numbers good before we go I'm feeling super lucky right now that this happened now and not when we were somewhere in the middle of absolutely nowhere where nobody was going to come find us so we're going to be going a lot deeper into Africa how lucky that we were within a fourhour drive of Namibia's best Land Rover mechanic I could keep saying it's down to human error the car can be reliable it just takes some good mechanics that actually care working on the car so yeah I'm confident that this is going to be the last of our problems on this trip and certainly we're going to have time in the next two days to iron out any other potential problems that we might come across with the car fixing fixing things tomorrow I'm feeling good about it I'm also feeling very lucky meet all these people and to come we would never have found ourselves in this beautiful part of the world and it really is stunning I'm going to do a little drone flight around the farm in the area tomorrow and really give you guys a better idea of where we are because it's stunning here it's amazing hopefully we're only going to be set back by two or three days I don't know we're going to figure it out but nothing compared to the inconvenience that we could have faced further along the trip and potential safety issue of being stranded and so going to make this car flipping awesome over the next two days and iron out any more kinks and now I keep saying that but I'm confident we're going to get there with Pumbaa but yeah I would take you guys tomorrow you"	1524
"no_Travel Vlog Come to Dubai with Me  anothergirlslife.txt"	"hello babes so I just wanted to quickly introduce this vlog because it's a little bit random I went to buy as you can tell from the title of this vlog to go and stay with my friend Angela it's kind of a holiday kind of see Angela and I had planned to properly vlog it as I usually would do but before I went to Dubai I was kind of feeling a bit like just out of sorts with everything I'm not really no I wasn't motivated but I just didn't feel like vlogging and anyone that makes content you know that if you don't feel like doing it you probably shouldn't do it because you're just not in the right headspace for it it's really weird too it's really hot it's really weird to explain but it wasn't it was partly because I was staying with Angela who for those of you that remember a few years ago I lived in London and Angela was my friend that I lived with and she's been in the Middle East for like two years now but she moves to buy about six months ago and so I haven't properly seen and spent time with her for ages so part of it was I just wanted to be with Angelo and just enjoy the time with her and just be present and not constantly thinking I'm gonna vlog I'm gonna do this because I barely even really took pictures I just wanted to be there and just experience and also cuz I've never been to Dubai before so I kind of just wanted to take it all in and I just feel like I didn't have the capacity to think about trying to vlog as well as just being in the moment and I knew as predicted when I got back that I would regret that and I would wish that I had flogged more and editing was talked together I do wish that I'd booked more of course so I didn't even vlog everything that I did but this is just kind of snippets of what I did whilst I was away I had the most incredible time I wasn't really expecting much I was just happy to be going away and having a holiday and being in the Sun but I just fell in love with Dubai and hopefully I'll be going back next year I'm sure Angela will be there for the foreseeable future so I've no doubt that I'll have more tips of Dubai then I can properly blog next time I go because I'll know what to expect but yeah I had an amazing time and as I said I didn't even really vlog everything that we did there's one clip in this vlog which I will explain we went to Abu Dhabi for the day and that's because Angela works for a department store they're called Triano and she had an event that evening that we had to go to so we went to Abu Dhabi to have a spa day and then we went to try on her in the evening and because she had put together a master class with a makeup artist called him and the implements are called Rania so there's a little bit of that in there that's just to explain why we were there because it kind of is a bit random like why would you go to that event but that was why cuz it was Angela's event so obviously I went to go and see see her store and see what she does which was really nice I just wanted to introduce this vlog regularly scheduled programming will be back up and running next week I feel like I've been a bit m.i.a just all over social media it's actually also my birthday today the day this vlog goes up the second of October so I've actually spent it working because I had loads of stuff to do but I had the whole weekend off and also I feel like Dubai was a little bit of a birthday celebration so I've had a lovely time and I going out to dinner this evening yes another year older but I hope that you guys enjoy this vlog and it's not too random I thought I would just upload it anyway and as I say I'll see you on my next video have you have you've been to Dubai maybe this will be a nice kind of nostalgia for you don't forget to subscribe if you're not and I'll see you in the next one I can see your mouth now I'm in Dubai I'm currently at my friend Angela's apartment maybe that's apologies my dick what if I don't look my best I got in this morning at 6: Oh and I arrived to Angelo's about o'clock and I just passed on the Seraphim hen asleep because it was a night flight which I thought I would sleep on and I didn't really so I needed to get some sleep because I was exhausted I've now had a shower I've got me half spruced up but my SPF on because I'm gonna head down to Angela's pool she's at work she have to go to wets mornings but she'll be back this evening and so yeah I'm just chilling out today and then we have like a spa day but tomorrow some friends of hers I think it may be one of their birthdays that we're gonna go up to some restaurants that we wanna go to so yeah I'm here tour someday I leave Monday morning and I'm just gonna have a nice big juicy her flat I'm so cute isn't it look at it look at that view it's not really anything it's just building but pretty decent living situation she's go ahead so yes white was fine I meant a blog a bit more like a cute Lynch oh and me being at the airport stuff though in all honesty I it was the first time I signed by myself and I'm such a nervous flier actually I'm a lot better than I was but I still get quite nervous so I couldn't really think no I was like I just want to get to Dubai home please I'm still quite tired so and it's about 40 degrees no it's not it's like 31 degrees degrees I think so let's see how long we lost by the pool I let me see what the temperature is saying oh oh God yay okay as I can see"	1187

"no_TRYING TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF  Lydia Elise Millen.txt"	"it's been a very wet and autumnal morning it's Saturday and I've had quite a productive morning and I got up I had a lovely cup of coffee with Lu me on the sofa and I read a little bit of a book and then Ali got up and we got ready I made some fruit salad which is something I'm doing a lot of at the moment because of over the last like month I spent so much time out of the UK and I haven't been getting in the gym and you can hear anything in the background that's just Ali getting ready but I haven't been getting in the gym at all and my diet is just really really suffered so I'm used to always having fruit like when I lived with my grandma we always had a big bowl of fruit in the fridge so that's something I really want to always do at my house so we're now doing that and so I made fruit salad this morning and I had a lovely big bowl of fruit that looked like skittles it was so nice and then we've been shooting some bits with Ali for some campaigns that he's working on and now we're gonna go shoot something else and we are gonna try and go for a coffee because I'd like to go get with him and yes it's just quite chilled Saturday at the moment the weather looks like it's brightening up now at the moment I know this is like Lydia's weather report but I always do but yeah it should be quite a nice chilled autumnal Saturday so this is what I'm wearing on this really cold and wet Saturday I've got my old like a sauce stripy jumper on which is from one of my old ACE hustles I've got this Club Monaco skirt which is like split like that which is from my hole that went live on Sunday I've got these Chloe boots which everyone always asks about and I've never ever seen them anywhere it's really strange I just ask them to get them in in my size and they manage to get them and then I've never seen them and then my Bulgari bag as well because it's just easy to just shove stuff in and go so don't have to think too much about that but yeah that's what I'm wearing so let's get going you look so cool in those sunglasses I never like this unless the camera comes out I just go by braindead put in okay we'll move for you I promise sorry guys team a lot of times on behind us pissing off the neighbors kids then we're just on our way to get some petrol because I like to let it get right down to the red before I fill up and then I was like you need to get petrol and I'm like yeah and then I make him do it so Ali's just filling the car up with petrol you might glad to see him back there doing so so I thought I'd tell you a little bit about my makeup because I've kind of changed things up a little bit since I last vlog so don't know whether you can notice but I've got none of my eyeliner flicks on I actually went to London yesterday for meetings that I didn't wear that's the first time I've ever gone to London like that it seems like such a small thing but they're kind of like my comfort blanket like I've just worn them for so long and now I'm just changing things up a little bit and I'm going and while I'm trying to go a little bit more freshfaced because as much as like I love watching girls slay their makeup I can't slay my makeup so I just like finding what works for me so I'm just trying this out I hope I don't look tired I've also got a new lip combo on which is Mac boldly bare and then look with Ebola that her stationary it's Mac boldly better than lip liner and Mac have just released their new lip densities and they sent me their entire range which was very very exciting so I thought that I would try them out and I've just found a color by apps that you love it's called doh and it's kind of like a brown you need this is I think this is a little bit darker than it is so I was scared to use this initially but it's really beautiful and it's really nice combined with boldly bear because it's kind of like a pinky color so if you're wondering what's on my lips that's what I have been wearing and I'm also going to be giving away the entire lip density so that that's what I'm going to be doing my two and jackée giveaway because I think that that's something more special than I could ever sort of afford to buy you guys so I thought that I would give away the whole range and yeah I think that's quite cool so I'm excited to hit 2 and okay I haven't hit it yet so don't start congratulating me just yet but I just want to let you guys know that that's why I will be giving away when I do finally hit it it's known life when you regret doing something what do you regret my head in fact Benjamin was a different five seconds well he came in you know way were you I don't think I could see you little kornhauser look back Vic be talking about my Baker with his ally Thank You head you make mistakes this is the story of my life I asked Ali to get me a diet Red Bull and he went to get himself one and got me the full fat one he always gets it wrong whenever I ask him to do so if me but now he has to self is he's having the fault that one so we just randomly arrived on a rooftop in Milton Keynes and we're about to sheet bit Sally just for his blog and something like that so I am behind the camera today I'm obviously not cheating on my olympus because I'm blogging on it but yeah I'm going to shoot mother Canon today it is 7:30 a.m. hence why I look like I've been punched in the face I'm having a quick espresso and I'm going to go to the gym I didn't get to finish blogging the other day because I I don't know what it was I think that September finally caught up on me and I just after I'd finished shooting I was just so tired and we just came home and just snuggled on the sofa I couldn't do anything else I was so tired September was probably one of the hardest months of my life it was just so fullon and so intense which meant that I guess finally you do crash and I just realized I'm only got one year again I'm heading to the gym this morning because the knockon effect of September is that I feel like uh tur crap in myself and that's not a lookswise it's a feeling lies like I don't feel healthy I don't feel like I've eaten healthy enough so I am going to the gym and I'm just gonna do a quick 5k and then probably do a little bit of weights as well and then I've got work to do all days I've also got to pick up a package oh and also I got my new iphone 7 plus which I have been learning how to use all of last night and it didn't quite update the way that I thought it would like I've not been able to transfer everything from my old phone on to this one and also you need new cases even though they're the same size because the cameras are in a different place so that was something I wasn't bargaining for coz I've got really nice cases my phone I think I've scratched my nose even my skin isn't as great as it usually is at the moment so I just generally feel a little bit crap so I'm going to do everything within my power to make myself feel better so I'm gonna release some endorphins I'm getting my hair done on Wednesday because a Productivity makes me feel so much better so I'm gonna have a really good day I think this is my gym outfit for the day I've got some vai active leggings on my sweaty Betty vest that's just my favorite and I've got this Matthew Williamson and USA Pro jacket which is actually a bit warmer than my other one and I also just love love love machi Williams and Prince so the fact I can wear it in the gym is amazing it's such good quality as well so I really do like this I just got some old night trainers on which I actually want to get some new just all black trainers so yeah these colorful summery ones and maybe not so much I guess I'm ready to go and make myself feel better so go and pound that cross trainer oh my god it's oak oh I absolutely love this season but it's freezing I need to get my proper coat out my car's totally frosted up at the moment so oh my god I look like crap I look ill and but yeah my car's completely frosted up at the moment so I'm waiting for it to defrost before I Drive thank you fast and they have psych hold time for the heated seat I set myself aside either way on this chart if you I can start make a change I know we walk for days boozing home this so I'm going to make myself a smoothie because I've got so much to do today so gotta have something quick and then I'm gonna have a bigger lunch I've got almond milk a fairly ripe banana and my protein powder this is the super Alexa protein powder which is kind of like vegan and organic it's brown rice and pea protein and it tastes absolutely amazing and like this tastes better than any normal protein it's not sickly and it's just packed full of so much goodness and I love fat it's all organic funny how you change growing up is that I remember nice but any diet crap in my body and now I love this organic stuff so let's knock up a quick smoothie and then jump in the shower this will be okay cooking to another day oh my goodness today was not supposed to be that busy I ended up having to have a phone call with a brand and I had low girls than I imagined I had I always do that I always underestimate what I've got to do and then I was finally about to eat something at Ali's mom turned up so I was like don't even front of her so I just had some lunch and now I'm gonna have some fruit and creme fraiche which and just success with and I'm finishing off do you remember what I made them Saturday that's all that's left so once I've eaten I'm gonna tidy up because I've made the house an absolute mess which is what I do on a regular basis like I just literally shove everything everywhere and then wait till the end of the day and tidy it up but it's been a good day I have been good I do like it when it's busy but obviously tomorrow I'm getting my hair done so I kind of needed to get everything done today I also look super tagged in this life what I've been using a new town I've been using the I'll show you I've been using the Santa Paws selftan this is the 1hour express one and again I just use it in the in the mornings like I usually do and the transfer is not really very bad at all and I love the color it is really dark like really dark I am now a seeing this on my body how dark is and yeah great I love it with it too hug ally ally you waited for daddy you waited for daddy to come through the door yes we are it's seven o'clock and I have just ticked the last thing off my todo list that's everyone's depop orders ready to go I am so sorry if anyone's waited a while for them I literally I just I'm so bad at this I always feel like it's not okay to make it sound like I am working hard because I know that a lot of people don't think that people on YouTube do any work at all and it's funny because it's seven o'clock and I'm still working and when I worked in an office I would never have still been working at seven pm five o'clock on the dot I would be out that door so I do work hard but I did actually schedule in some time today to relax and that's something that I really want to do I want to relax a little bit more in the evenings and not overwork myself because as much as I love working I also love being sane and yeah so I've been scheduling and some time to read a little bit more because I absolutely love reading and I've got books mounting up by the side of my bed so these are all books that I want to read I mean I started reading the lifechanging magic is not giving a fuck but it's a it's lovely difficult to get into so I'm reading a different book that's downstairs at the moment that these two I really really want to get through so now I think I'm going to do is I'm going to light a candle I'm going to get a blanket and I'm going to spend the next half an hour to an hour just reading and I'm going to enjoy every single minute of it into danger zone it all points right to them I set myself aside me the way on this chart if you don't know it's so nice to just sit on the sofa and chill like just relax I can't tell how good it feels I've been reading bloom by Estee Lalonde I don't actually know esday but her book arrived and I was sort of I don't know like I just I was intrigued so I read the first few pages and whilst I was having a bowl of fruit the other day and before I knew it I was on page 103 and now I can't put it down it's so beautifully written and I feel like we're the same person I feel like we feel the same way about animals and the way that she felt about friendships and the way that she felt about her grandma like it's just so lovely to read and I have no doubt that I would have finished it very very soon because now that I'm having this new relaxation it's them gonna be part of my everyday so I hope that I'm gonna get through a lot more books now and yeah I really enjoyed it if you did give it a thumbs up and don't forget to hit the subscribe button because we're almost it turned UK I see you in my next one 9 this time we'll be okay"	2841

Meldrum was talking about electric toothbrush I don't know if it is this one or not but she was like oh it's loads of money on Amazon and then I saw this on like the today's deals I'll link it I don't

calm and then it has little quotes for every day next box this is a bottle sterilizer I have this exact thing with audacity I wish have kept things I don't think I'd have more and basically you just put all the bottles in this thing here you put a little bit of water in the bottom and then you put it in the microwave for a set amount of time and it just does it's so easy it takes two minutes and it effectively kills 99.9% of germs how I should probably talk now about this because I know they'll become it's about it there will be some people in the comments are gonna be like oh my God why are you buying that aren't you going to exclusively breastfeed because breastfeeding and bottle feeding is such a hot topic I'm being realistic with myself of Darcy and I breastfed for a week and then couldn't do it and I know a lot of people like Billy you should try harder we were both hospitalized because we had such problems with it I lost a lot of blood and delivery and then just could not make the milk up and I just got very down about it and I was just really not a good time for us at all so with this baby I'm just being realistic I'm gonna if breastfeeding happens then look great and if it doesn't happen then I'm gonna have all the stuff ready to go all the bottles and the sterilizes and I won't a work pill I won't feel guilty about it like this time because I spent so much of my time feel it like wracked with guilt for being this like disgusting terrible mother and then she turned out alright so that's what I'm doing I'm aware that this is gonna be an ongoing topic in the comments but there we are it's a bottle sterilizer this one is heavy I think this will be wipes these are wipes for cleaning a baby's bottom after they've used them happy and I can use these with dog is like Huggies or pampers or just whatever I bought at the time but I've heard great things about these because they're chemical free 99.9% water not put 1 percent fruit extract National eczema Association accepted allergy UK friendly product so I was like yeah kept those make a filing you pack 720 wipes the boxes sounds breakable so I bought some things for post birth to get ready for postpartum and I did some research and apparently this is good it's the Aquarius refresher bday and this is might be a bit TMI for some people so I had a marginal worth of dobbsy and that first we we you do after you've had the baby those first few we B's my god do they sting they'll be like mothers of another country being like yes so apparently I didn't use this last time I just would like grinned and Burdick's to all the grit like like correcting my hand towel um and we at the same time into a toilet see you fill this with water and then you can just put it here and like as your we're you can squirt water on your area and dilute the discomfort I'm gonna do a whole video on basically like fanny prep that I'm doing for this I'm feeling for natural delivery have a scary I won't use that well I think um yeah the bathroom what's in the box it's captures fairy lights and what these as a Christmas present for someone do look like fat jolly good I also bought this book a nineteen fifties mother bringing a baby in the 1950s I thought that would be really interesting I saw someone do a video about what life in the 1950s I thought give that a Regis foot for jolly okay my bedding my Christmas bedding that I bought looks like they're elves thought that was a bit fun and then I also bought Darcy vintage kittens for her bedding look that vintage kittens if you will and I also bought the baby to fidget Jersey copper sheets to go ahead bed so I bought a couple of hooded towels three hooded towels for seven pound fifty or they feel soft at all wash and I'll be ready then this what a change Matt I've actually all support oh it's not as sturdy as I'd have thought and why it's sturdy up wants to spin out of the box for a while um I've got some run away from mother care as

champion by sarah wehmanen bloody love fat woman she is Hilaire so this is Henry Burke Sarah McMillan's how to be champion an autobiography hello Louise thank you so much for agreeing to read my book she messaged me on twitter I'll bite in yes I really hope you like it and if you do be so grateful if you could tweet about it Facebook it all mention it on Instagram if that's where you play I mention in it in a video by the way thank you by way of X you please wanna go since that's your biscuits a bit especially made alrighty and well up Sarah here you are this if you're interested in this book I will leave a link to it below who has all she's had lots of good lots of good like recommendations that I don't car Kathy Burke Frank in Adria Brown for Phillip Schofield and Dawn Frankish if that doesn't wet your whistle I don't know what will and that completes our like the unboxing at segment I will leave it here for today because tonight we're going to Ikea with doodles to buy a copter baby I'm sorry tomorrow or Wednesday bye good morning it's Wednesday and as you can see we have the cot up I can't remember if I showed it yesterday or not so I'll show it to you now it is from SNAs pod snooze pod or snas pod and you can actually unzip the sides and then securely it's got straps hang on here are all the straps and stuff you can attach it to the side of your bed so that you can safely cosleep you can also take this off which is pretty cause if I want to take this downstairs when the baby what steep downstairs I can but the thing I wanted to show you which was the cutest as I found this I put this and this in here obviously when baby's born I'm not going to keep stuff in her cot but I found this Darcy had obviously put her little tiny tiny baby in the bed and then on the wristband she's called it Jane I know it says the back was J eatin em but that's how does he would write Jane and then my birthday she's put April so Jane was born in April which is funny because das has made my name is Jane and she was born in April and she's put her there so I think I'm gonna leave her there until I have to take all the stuff out a washer obviously I need to wash this this is the most gorgeous gorgeous muslin from agen and ace that's her mother care I've got some bedding from George Ann stare um yes I was in Tasha all but just gonna leave that there for now it's all starting to feel a bit real Jimmy Bob Chapman is coming to play today we're gonna film some videos so I've like semi tied up aka shoved all the junk in that room and a little bit more tidying up to you actually I think we're gonna film a video on making money online which feels like a scary thing to talk about because my dad always taught me it was really crass and really rude and really vulgar to talk about money it was rude to talk about how much money you earn it's definitely rude to ask someone else how much money they earn and it's rude to show off or boast about money in any way now I know a breath of that so stressed out about that now I know that some people might not think that at all obviously it's just a matter of opinion it's just something that I've been brought up to think that way and but I'm finding increasingly I'm asked about how you make how do you make money does your job make money or in some cases very rudely how much money do you make I've been asked on national television three times how much money I make and I'm never gonna want sir that question online because I think it's rude to ask someone that but I mean on TV or anywhere I think if it's a topic that people are really interested in and also a lot of people want to do the same kind of thing that I'm doing at Jim's doing a lot of other people are doing I thought it might be interesting just to talk about it in like the most appropriate and polite way that I can without being vulgar or and without being too much if that makes sense I would be really fascinated in the comments to know what do you think about talking about how much you were and I'm not asking you what you think of youtubers earnings or anything like that or I'm not asking you to divulge your information but do you think that it's okay to talk about that do you think people should ask about that he had yarder interested to know so I'm gonna go and sit down and like plan some notes because I want to be thorough and I want to be careful and I want to be helpful in this video so I'm gonna go sit and plan that look who is here it is Jim with never want you never mind me what do you think it's so cute that's I'm talking to the cat so big strangers got me thank you miss strangers got me very squatchy she was laugh at you I'm going to film a video Jim now I'm dead gay oh this is a good outcome she just don't like that although you are I really think of myself I know I think although I'm talk about everything on the house who I am and so life I get into situations like this where you can just see my nipples he's look there's one knot belly ones absolutely categorically no I know it's a beautiful thing I know it's like but my sister was pregnant it was like it was at capacity was nearly gonna go it was about to pop out and I couldn't even be around it oh really that's how I like it excellent right that see thoughts on Sphinx cats please where's Jim here is just telling me that his brother bought a stinky and Jim said it looks like his ball back you're specific yet huh him insult how do I look like my ball back it's much later on in the day now and Liam is home and is making some dinner

"no_UNPACKING MY MAKEUP COLLECTION  GLAM ROOM ORGANISATION"	"hello welcome do love so always just some very bright now you probably can't see happy Monday moving block three so visible to kind of happen that since I lost weight you have a sofa deliver the smoker is being taken back because it doesn't look right it doesn't that's too big so what else winter put my bed up and just little bits of bottle that I didn't feel me because I just feel like you know see me put up furniture so the most exciting thing in the world so today we have a ton of things to do is actually actually and I'm supposed to be in London but I mean I've moved house so I can't get to like you might think with me to be in London so I'm unpacking as much as I can today so I can pack and go to London the rest of the week but the main task today is to unpack my makeup which is gonna be a task in a half but we just did get over there and see how it goes it should be fine we've just been and done a few job and got some bits and bobs and I have a chocolate for us all let's embrace ID and there's a new style bit scenarios which we just visited wasn't it pretty good experience it's under it's just the same as the other one but they're contactless so it's really bad and wastefully money on coffee but yeah on Monday is being you know it started really well very positive so yeah I'm just I'm very excited for the week ahead and I just stick things up because I know a lot of you ask the AMA so using my blog channel kind of what's going down I will still be vlogging with log Channel I'm just doing my movie adults on my main channel because I know so many of you wanted to see what was going down so the fashion week that'd be fun wouldn't it but then behind the scenes what's going on if I get to come back yeah yeah okay so let's just text me and let me look at me that's not going to be really disappointed with the g7x back we should probably bring up hurry up mom which bar in Cannon and see what's going down okay so this is what we're working with this is my makeup that needs unpacking yeah there's quite a lot like not time any other so all needs to go in these drawers and I've got these Alex drawers as well but we're going to start with these ones fast because I'm actually gonna arrange it with my brand as opposed to kind of product tight just because I feel like that's way easier for me a lot of drawers so yeah we're kinda just gonna have to make it work so I have the going little test are you actually just playing with the makeup yeah so this is what we're working with it's you know we get him better but there's just still boxes full but I mean we've started to know who's empty looks I'm not done anything so we've got drawers but we're getting there I want to show you some of the drawers over here these are kind of the interesting rules yeah that's Nick to face it they're all very might actually show them they wire cells that make it home to gay YSL in George Armani drawing only gorgeous that's what everything's gonna eventually but as you can tell I am doing everything by Brown this time this how it's being organized so yeah it's just looking a bit different to how it looked previously I think it's gonna work better for me so that's what we're going with but yeah I just have it three of the flat Alex units kind of stacked up on top of each other and then I have to Alex nine drawers so in here is going like brands that I kind of don't use as much or they're never as much product from so like anyway Max Factor brands like that and then just here I'm getting idea packs units all the way up to the ceiling of drawers to put skincare all things like that in so yet all of their and all of that is makeup so we're getting there we don't do bad hi and we make seven vej is not going to focus because just over some things there's a tap netbook Chris look there's a lot of there's a lot of Matt but you know sometimes you just have to listen to what your body wants and my body and what am i play toy sure yeah what's new so we are eating salmon taboo carrots for inherit and white Paris manners the unpacking is continued we have moved on to perfumes just to kind of change up a little bit I mean I think the major progress is going pretty well isn't it no reply they're not honest legal that an exception to but I just go back to my purse you'd say actually keep all the boxes which I know sounds extremely excessive but I see just moved quite frequently over the last few years so it just seemed to make sense to keep them all but I have just come to the conclusion I have an unnecessary amount of perfumes but I just wear them on different occasions so I can't get rid of them I'm gonna zoom you in and show you perfect use that do you have we'll have a little talk to him real quick so everything's a bit kind of messy I literally just took them out of their boxes and I'm not put them anywhere so I'm gonna put the GCU chopper Frank so wear this all the time I have some new ones I don't check yet I haven't tried yet this and some go down at this one is sky with Georgia Romani and just a few so I have two juicy controls because well a lot of times I'm going to pop them at the back because it's obviously too this is new one from George Armani and this one is kind of the female and one is the male but obviously you can wear either literally I'm for the man yeah I prefer the male one too so this is you know number five actually boards by mistake and when there's no number five at the fresh world I didn't actually know it's called but it yeah it was the wrong one so it's gonna go towards the back so we're too often George Armani see is like my goto like evening out so I'm gonna have these right in the front because these make me feel amazing I also love this one by replica this is lazy Sunday morning thing made me one of these inspired by one of my pictures which i think is absolutely incredible so kind of them so I need to go pick that up from my management but yeah this one got my name on it quite a few from her and I personalized which is absolutely fab have quiet for future rolf ones they have some incredible settings so I'm gonna put C right here got my dropping everything I've got my Monsieur and then my miss your absolutely and please ignore my chip nails it's a very embarrassing my Gila Hicks at la Cruz love this this is fab now these are actually filters for the replica perfumes and what they do is kind of change that like kind of tone of it so you can like glut make it more glow or like make it glow more even like blur it love Gilly hooks this is going in the front these are quite similar to be fair like they broke quite fresh perfect and I'd wear them both kind of on similar occasions and then my newer ones kind of near the front so I use them more and then of course we have to have a little space for all the rubbish that I accumulate on the edge of my perfume cabinet so that looks quite lovely doesn't that look so on this one's sky but George Armani I've never actually tried this let's spray chested Oh Jo who ever did like design the packaging it smells exactly like you'd expect in the packaging like by looking at that does the perf you not smell exactly like you would expect in a package that looks like this yeah I could imagine that mmhmm ring is really nice but not the kind of thing too far I'd probably wear that on a day to day it's not too floral E but like I'm more so for evening times Georgia money Sears like my everything I need some more like kind of ug perfumes when wonder where every silver day that Fairless do to control the original one this is amazing since you're sickling yes it's all like sixteen I've had so many bottles this is the new one and this is Finch share from clueless this is share and a part of you this isn't people of juicy glass a and I went to dinner for it the other week to kind of learn all about the perfume and is just incredible smells amazing the only reason it's going to back is because it's near my house no juicy control one has to be there of each other so yeah that's pretty much my perfume collection I mean I'm pretty impressed with it I don't know about you but I think it looks really pretty but it's gonna be a pain to dust around them but you know you do you just do some things just cuz you know they look nice so that's where I update so with an for a day pretty much we just have some bits and bobs like the rest is stuff basically we didn't have drawers for yeah but like I said perfumes done in here we bought more kind of drugstore makeup that we don't have much of I think we get is team effort everything shared in this house we don't have my higherend makeup which I don't have as much job so like Marc Jacobs I love that product I've got you know a full drawer full of besides but not enough to fit in like the larger drawers so they have their own special drawer here my things have beautiful palettes by the way there's a few in here that I'm just like so in love with hey everyone so we are finished or about to head off to the gym we've done as much as we can today but I'm going to back later to like move my desk and stuff so I will show you but we have to take a quick way to go to the gym I've got my gym camera and we're going to the gym let's go so pleasing all the horrific lighting I picked the shortest bulb ever but this is how we're looking got my desk in just to keep the same desk that I had previously just because it's you know works out better kind of value for money to eat that I've got my drawers have got there the drawers and then the rest of the stuff to put away down here I in fact you're coming with me yeah not really not bad so I just want to end this vlog off by saying that there is more coming soon my baby is back I figure is so hard to film unlike other cameras to vlog with but I realized like say a massive tank he's accounted for fixing my camera again she had a smash screen I say she because my camera is my baby like it's also silly but I did not realize how hard it was to manage without this little thing so yeah we're back to vlogging we are back to one point content but good quality so yes uh thank you so much watching this vlog I really do hope you enjoyed it please do leave me a comment down below if you did enjoy and we can have a little chat

dice and you Lucy little a college man we may have cuz Lucy and Meg we've probably said this million before in every single video but we're now going to go through some foods we're gonna take you guys with us song thing we're gonna go to the ivy you can feel I know I've never been so excited about my favorite place if we can get in if not it'll be blue but it's not we'll find someone just something to do but because we couldn't get into the I've a beautiful evening strange else be a restaurant honey now finally in restaurant we actually made into Bluebird is Chelsea with us until I say we just ordered than the cocktail and a drink we are now into swimming pool swim because every civil day whatever the weather whatever the time of day it will make time for a swim so we have during the night so wish us luck welcome frequent swim hi guys welcome to Wednesday so this morning I've just been doing a list of work today we have a few meetings so we probably won't be able to film too much today and then we're going through the theater tonight see June girls of Perry which I'm so excited for this so that should be our third time seeing it but again won't be able to film too much of that either because you know I have to take cameras so today might be a bit random it might be a little bit short but we'll try and make it interesting for me all right I need to get the camera out a little bit more sometimes I feel like I'm I just forget like I'm in the moment and I forget and then after I'm like I haven't filmed anything oh this song all these bees coming music Lucy and I can't actually live music I'm looking very brunette but actually yesterday I wasn't liking it and now I actually quite like it I don't exchange it mother thinks I should go back purple but then I do like being blond but then we have yeah this is the other P so I do like looking twinning even though hair is such big thing and the inflate is only hair so purple for me lasted three weeks but how cool was it to have perhaps I just feel like do I try a different color I do want it cut because it's just so long the moment I feel like I can't curl it properly I'm just gonna finish a description box because I do the description box is if you like my discussion boxes that we know I want easily take me hours especially like if we do to get the look video for people I link everything so I'm not the queen of description boxes so please if you do like description boxes please read them sometimes I think what am i doing spending hours builded is good boss but it's really really helpful I find especially when you watch a video and you want to know where something's from and someone doesn't think it's honestly the most annoying thing so I feel like description boxes aren't very important so I'm gonna do that now and then we're going to go for lunch haha it's very likely right like I know it's like if you're in LA it's very ni with like high shoes yes very la like kind of yeah but it's

other exciting slippery was something that I ordered which I need to show you I have an ad yes it's kind of gonna be a little unboxing openness thing that we have is the Minnie Mouse cake tin I basically got this because I thought it might make me want to make a cake I mean it probably won't but I'm thinking if my mom comes to say she's really good at making cake and then it could be a Minnie Mouse cave I just think it'd be really nice I saw online and I thought hmm and then the next thing I got was a Walt Disney Studios little notepad I thought this would be really nice to put on

yeah don't have to buy or what I did I like the champagne glasses everything the glasses about oh maybe our guests as well and they're like cute in the beasts things I think people would probably

work out like and how to do this so it is Wednesday and what I have to say yeah it's been a few days of I love slobs obviously you saw the proposal and it went amazingly but Liv was still in shock like I was expecting her to cry immediately but she was just completely in shock I wasn't expecting it yeah I was a really nice way to spend a Sunday so now it's Wednesday I'm going to go to my new coworking space I found a temporary place in central London it's a bit more central which is good and they've done a special deal which is also good I'm going there to give myself a little bit structure and then I've got a few events as afternoon so I've got this ring making event something she's wine and jewelry making so yeah that's I should be pretty cool I've got a Travel blogging event later on about the Philippines and you know I'm excited because I don't know much about the Philippines I really like to learn more and cutting in between I might go to Brixton because I don't know if you know the blogger Freddy Terrell she's got a hair shop called big hair no care and she sells clipping afro hair extensions and I am very tempted to go there I get some hair extensions just to you know give my hair a bit more volume because at the moment is it's a bit shrunken I'm a bit paranoid maybe the issues that I haven't really stretched it enough I try to stretch it without heat but I'm getting a bit bored so yeah I don't know I might just go and see what clip in extensions alike and my boy um because I just fancy adding a bit more volume and you know being able to tie up when I just can't be bothered so I think I'm going to try and pop them in between hopefully I'll have time I've got party tomorrow and black ballad party tomorrow and then shout out lies on Saturday which is a podcast festival so one of the I want my hair to look nice but and now I need to get my hair down for my birthday but I don't want to get it done now because I want it to look nice my birthday so it's just so much forward planning and I still don't know what hair I want for my birthday I don't know whether to get crochet braids even though I've never had them before and I don't have to look after them or something that I've looked after before so still still like a bit indecisive about that and making it into a bigger deal than it probably is but you know that is just me yeah let's take it in to London the surviving a matter of Utah's Irish home it made around the washing and of the total talk and then the model terms are quite now hold up so then what better a little better as that people in Texas these are my types of accessories and my ring or rapidly increasing so yeah really exciting your soul & alove Rizzo a travel to tackle a oh wow a wellknown hi creatures knocking over next Locker Navy oh oh I think the dream actually I'm going to be comfy inside okay usually when we work with a brand or a destination something they constantly telling us is that sort of push the drinking too much and I don't tell people is that I've always been kind of fun and when we went to meet the 15m bethey they said can we do a big Italian competition very funny people we like working with the worst weather ever my hair is the painful event and anything else a bit so now it's going to head home because my name's Robin suburban ivy and I and knowledge might start reading so like furnaces laundry open them all now and then you'll see all your disinvited and live your vomit just keep untangle until your texture of hair basically my new hair is in this bag I want out of the zero drama queen and apparently this is enough to give my hair a bit of a booth and I got a look like Explorer so you're pretty seen on the blob train is our hopefully succeeded just get distracted by this coulis inside actions on the hallway I found there I found her and I'm really really early get started I think I got nails man select our answer because we were under nails the clutch life subscribers I found that later but we luckily have an equality of intense work growth has been free no charge you have pretty bad at the end and forgive me I'm just a baby summer party that's why people comment and the tree internal power I Oh leave any sofa I had a lot of respect oh yeah we're being sick now I had a very kind of great time fabulous feeling kind of salad boy glasses been here you should have been here because an end of law school today okay you more or the day after whatever I know so is Saturday I'm going to untwist my hair I'm just done my makeup I'm going to try and do you know the Pharaoh I'm going to try any lecture pins as well so we'll see how that goes I think the last hours logged was Thursday so I went to really cool event the black ballad summer party and yet but ballad is a really cool online magazine for black women and it's definitely needed because I find I mean even speaking to my friend who runs it Toby she will pitch articles to magazines and whatnot that the only ones that get picked up I like race related ones or something has happened you know something it was like flags off Beyonce's pregnancy those you'll get commissioned to write about that but if she just wants to write about getting married or you know something else then that doesn't tend to get commissioned so she created a magazine where black women can be their unapologetic selves and it just has like the whole spool experience which is really cool some really great articles on there and they host events so because I'm a member got to go to the event that was pretty cool and keeps a pretty cool I need to extend my vocabulary it's just such a great like network of women obviously Matt benjamina I'm a gonna work from advertising I met some journalism students and they're you know some really interesting people with really interesting stories and perspective so it's great that she's able to facilitate this and bring us all together because sometimes when you grow up in you know really non diverse places it's hard to find your network and she's been able to create that stuff they're really cool so what else has been going on has been a bit of control z about the bloggers blog Awards not being very diverse and so it's you know I was a seed in a few tweets by grace because I know grace picked up on it quite early I was out I was out for one something on my phone watching it all happens oh yeah I mean I just think I mean I'm never like aghast when these things happen because I always think let's let's go back let's go back like this is the result let's figure out how we got to this results I think we need to look at like what award ceremonies like do we need award ceremonies because it's very tricky when you start a blog like a personal blog and you do it and it's democracia you can do whatever you want and then you get pitted against other people you know the whole point of some people creating blogs because they didn't see themselves represented when it gets put into a traditional awards context I find that the traditional biases can come into play and is it fair to be putting these picking these blocks against each other like what is the measure of a good blog but that's not another question but I think we just you know if they look at the people voting for these awards who are very reading why are they reading these blogs I just think there's like a series of different issues and I think people need to look at their own biases and I see some places by says Isis Isis I don't make any sense but if you know I think if you are white you need to look at the bloggers reading you could read a blog by someone who looks different to you even if it's a beauty blog you know you can you can learn things I read blogs blogs from everybody every race every color and I took us on other things you know I may not get the exact same I mean you think I'll like them by this foundation color obviously but I might learn about a different kind of product or a way to apply a product or something I don't think this is as coherent as I would have liked it to have been but I know there are some people that grow up you know my friends some of my friends they maybe unlike the first black person they ever met and they may have had certain sections that based on what they seen in the media like which is nothing basically I think there's so many different issues that can result in that sort of awards list or list of whoever nominees and I think that's the thing that we need to discuss and understand and you know ultimately improve yeah there's some really interesting articles I'll put them down below one is about the use of digital blackface so the fact that black people always been using means but we're not being you know put into campaigns you know the YSL campaign came out and there's like one darker foundation amongst like a sea of beige so yeah that was a really interesting article I'll leave links down below to I've been reading and I also put everything into my dedicated race Pinterest board I'll leave those for you I think I might still trying to clip in yeah the last time I know clippings my hair is relaxed and I got really damaged so I would always be skeptical about getting more clippings I don't want to live in my everyday I just want the little styling options you know sometimes when the shrinkage is real so this is everything that's very different to what my hair looks like that you know so we've got one big flip so they're sort of saying is this is kind of how it looks and then you're meant to just brush it out and then once it's brushed out you don't get these curls back so okay so we're getting a bit more of an afro texture now so I'm going to pop my hair got the memories the memories whoo sorry oh wow oh god what a fun pop mullet oh oh this is a little bit surreal I don't know if I've done this right maybe I need to do a bit higher I feel like I've got I'm on it I thought it was gonna be easy it's given me a lil bit of volume it is kind of like sculpture in a way and I don't think I'd prepared enough time to create the sculpture so yeah and I denote the back maybe I should have done with maybe slightly shorter lengths because I just wanted it to kind of mimic my own hemant yeah I think I'm kind of there I put in two short pieces and then like a medium sized piece in the back well yeah I think it's going to be quite you know exciting to have guaranteed volume and I'll probably feel a little bit more like my face is you know framed so yeah I think I'm almost ready to head out as I said I'm going to Pandora vent it's a summer picnic which is outside it keeps you know raining on and off so that will be interesting and then I'm going to shout out live which is a podcast festival for people of color so there's melanin melanin millenials another round they've come over and a few other ones if you have a podcast so hopefully won't be too late oh my god it's twenty plus one I better go I check the back of my hair one more time and hopefully I'll be ready to go so I'm here for Pandora summer policy and I guess you know perms they put on things throughout the year so this seems to be like a blogger and VIP customer event and they've taken over square in regions parks it's one of those Gardens that you can't normally come into my most currently the queen poster party here that's quite nice and yeah a stocked up on gin and food though all good that's now raining super cool I'm going to hit chart lighthouse basically indoor the hours how does it miss too much but you know Lisa hammer Jim Padma ginseng so good chiropractor as become smaller and my time to speak up here never work the rapport with HR Roger Bob where we lagged you're right happens no matter how hard I tried I couldn't do it if someone was asking me for like the times in the workplace like watching what's that on your head back into that what you call that scar on my head I had a she was that you have been indoctrinated by a manner of thinking that clarifies not all and only fuck it's not fun it's not fun so stop trying it and having two leaders in the hole to help you feel better that's wrong you should have known yeah hello I'm back home now and blending in with my kitchens so again that was a really good day at the Pandora then and then shout out live I just love podcast like I love getting absorbed and you know listening to the debate and then when you get to watch them live there's just such a great atmosphere and yeah it's just a really fun way to spend a Saturday and it's the only Festival why I ended up going to this year I think it's a really good idea and I hope you know that the network succeeds because I feel like they're doing great things the showers Network my top comment goes to Champaign twist she also like waded in and defended me because someone said something about my vlog so you know I love I welcome constructive criticisms but we someone says there's too much talking in your vlog it's a vlog of vlog video blog vlog bit weird when criticism to mix and no sense whatsoever but thank you champagne twist for being really nice and

"no_VLOG  I Need To Sort My Business Out"	"anything induced by the pita loved it and the pita turns you like Baywatch style intro hi the braids are back yes whenever I'm going to leave the country I change my hair so got some braids and I'm looking forward to doing the updos you know the swept across things I did forget to ask for parting so don't really have partying it's a bit of a different different look but yeah so this is the week before I go away so I've finally for my flight details I'm flying out to New Orleans on Monday it's such a felt scarily real like even more real I need to sort out blood contents I need to try and like prepare you know the next two weeks worth of posts which is not something I'm used to doing you know I always try and get ahead of myself and then I'm just never ahead of myself which is annoying I'm going to try my best also writing some content for another website so I've got to make sure I get that ready plus my videos I really want to have a video going out every Sunday there's a single business development which is quite important when you're a freelancer so you've got to you know set aside a certain amount of time per week to develop as a business and that is something I probably don't do enough of so for me it's just chasing emails identifying your opportunities you know finetuning things whatever so I'm going to try and do a bit of that you know I want to get as much done as possible so I can be on that plane and watch the movies but I want to catch up on all the oscar films because i just forget to see films and then i just watch them all on the plane so that is the plan this morning I'm going to head to the Oasis press stay because I find with blogging sometimes you'll you'll be on a brands list and then that person leaves and then you go for two years without that invite or that connection and then you get back on the list so you know I'm at the back on the list stage so I'm going to go there and then I might have an event in the evening I'm not sure it depends on how how much work I get done I'm hoping to go to this Israeli food event so fingers crossed and get my work done and I can take you with me that is the plan for today so better leave it's like randomly like degrees today and I refuse to wear a winter coat so I've got thermals put this dress on and I'm going to put socks on as well so that is a plan so let's do this Wednesday this is interesting and acts against it for me before it's the first time I can it look like this hello so I've just been to the Israel event but a little bit about Kennedy's actor Bruce alone apparently Kennedy is like really happening and it'll be cool should we and in history as all at home might try and work on something else and then in Tunisia fulfilling

Bowdoin event and then went to the correcting space and kind of finished off the content that I need to write for a client that make sense the client I work on lots of different things at once and I keep doing drafts and dress until i'm happy and i think that's just just how I'm going to do it yeah I've been planting a lot of seeds recently and some of them are growing that sounds really really cryptic but yeah fingers crossed you know free arms life is going to continue touch some wood and all that I'm going to go to Zumba please finish of approach that I need to do for tomorrow don't know if I can do it in front of girlboss has anyone else been watching girl Bluffs on Netflix I'm on episode I think eight or nine Netflix is so bad for like making you binge watch and yeah I find the main character quite annoying but you know I'm very intrigued as I've read the book obviously know the story of Nasty Gal so I want to see how they do it and how it plays out and I quite like a style as well even though she's annoying so yeah that's how my Thursday evening is looking so I'm just about to get ready because I'm going to shoot some pictures with Georgia because I wanted your post on the best nude lip colors for dark skin tones so we're going to go to shoot by the pink wall that you've probably seen before expecting a that shot edited and then come back I want to film a fashion video so I'm going to do it in my room normally I go out and about but I'm going to try and do it here I should be multitasking let me watch yourself I just know I have crap everywhere so Jack know how how interesting it's going to be okay so I'm putting on one thing I'm putting on my wife's el primer and god I'm using this Nippon fab color corrector which is quite cool because I put it on and just

the Chinese the rest of this Lancome foundation I picked up a sample at fennec it's quite handy they'll match your shade and give you a free sample and I think I've used this for about I don't know five oh bloody hell I've just cut it and it's gone on my desk or click didn't go on me and you can get a free sample so you can find out your shade and actually test it because I just find it takes me

not Taj Mahal so I've been using this a lot it's just very golden I try and put a lot on the cheek more on the cheek and I like blend it out I think you can pretend that you're using a highlighter but it's really just all blush I look mad oh bloody how I put too much on so you thing is you need to like really build it up because you can go overboard mmm the bareMinerals bear pro powder in chai 26 just to set everything but what I've been using quite a lot is my morphe 360 palette there's so many different shades but I only use only really been using this shade in the middle I just love this

going to try and make it work in my messy bedroom hello so I think I made it work I've got my light on my bed you can see my setup yeah it's just really tricky when you try and do everything in your bedroom and I realize I probably probably can't do another video like this but you know I've tried it I've tried it and yeah I'm glass the plan a little more in the future but yes I think I've made it work I'm going to make some food I think it's gonna make it sorry gonna look on Pinterest for a bit of inspiration so this is what I'm going to make lentil and sweet potato curry but I'm missing the coriander don't really want to buy coriander when I'm only here for like 3 more days so might see if one of my housemates have some and this is the finished meal so I've got lentil sweet potato and chickpea curry bit of coriander in there with couscous mango chutney and poppadoms it's quite a good one to make it full of store cupboard ingredients pretty much and it's made quite a decent quantity so I might put it in the freezer so yeah that's my wild Friday night I think I'm going to watch an episode of girl boss might shoot myself and then I'm going to try and start editing this so yes see

"no_VLOG  I'm 30"	"I think I'm just gonna enjoy being you know 30 I did it sound so weird why why so hello I am back I'm vlogging again I'm 30 I've got new hair I had tonsillitis that's my little update for you I need to get ready as well because I've got a photo shoot today with Lauren so if you don't know Lauren she's an amazing blogger and human and just a great communicator she's been battling breast cancer for the past year you know it's it's all good at the moment but she's still like taking certain things like it's really interesting she's documented her journey over on social media so every day she'll post a story you know with updates as to what she's doing and she's been selling tshirts to raise money for just living her life because when you're you know when you're a millennial when you're single you know who's gonna look after you if you don't have a husband or anything you have to look after yourself so she's done that to raise money for her life and then also for some cancer charities so I'm actually go to a photo shoot I think she's got a new batch of tshirts and she wants you know some for friends too so models I'm gonna do a bit of modeling today I need to leave in minutes but and it's not too far like it's not too far but you know your most annoying thing about London is that some places and not that far like to drive it won't be that far but if you've got to get public transport it's a bit of a mish and I'm not gonna do because I'm not about the uber life I'm gonna try and get ready and talk to you the same time right moisturizer so 10: obviously I was freaking out and I was talking about it I mean talking about it for the past few months and I know I was just like I'm gonna be thirsty like not actually believing it now I'm actually 30 and it's weird cuz it doesn't doesn't really seem real until you have to tell people your age and I haven't actually had to tell anyone my age so at the moment I'm in this weird limbo it's obviously like dreading my birthday um you know the age itself and then what to do food birthday because I feel like you know you always have to be doing something and I just me me being silly thinking it's like New Year's Eve everyone's like what are you veneers Eve when we are in reality no one cares it's like you're only gonna say I'm doing this and I'll be like oh great I'm doing this when it's your 30th you know you feel like you've gotta be I denied you feel that you gotta be painting the town red or something or organizing a big old party or you know doing something to the sake of it and I was like I didn't know what to do I knew only to do but then I left it so long to book the flights and you always had to Budapest I named it Budapest be a really cool place to go to and it was cheap but then I left the flights like really late and you know IRA Grudge paying you know 200 pounds for a variety of like that's what I ended up doing because you know Lucy convinced me and she's like you know you've got one thirtieth got to make it a good'n I just thought do something you love you know you love travelling Gary travel go over there friends explore a new city eat some food and just get some Sun and have a good time that's what we did and it was just so great because we just what would loosen Carrie we just had so much fun like so many laughs even though it was really hot it's crazy we were here it was sort of cold here we were moaning it was cold here and then we got there and it was hot there were like oh it's too hot and it's like we're never happy we just have really city chats like city jokes like there was a bar called basic bar I was joking like Lucy was basic because she was wearing shorts at a tshirt and I feel like I've had an active several epiphanies so weird I need to reflect on it but I always do a blog post I still haven't finished it she's really annoying but maybe you know feel like I had to go away to sort of realize what all need to say most birthdays are kind of just like meh and then I you know move on but this birthday was just so good and then I had like the post birthday blues which I was really not expecting so just really sad to come home I was really sad it was all over and then I had tons of lighters it was annoying cuz I just wanted to get back to work and creating stuff again and I had to rest and it always takes me a little while to work out where if I'm actually ill and most of the time I'm just like you know if I can move I'm fine but I just felt myself getting worse and I paid him I throw was just so horrible so yeah last week I was just kind of resting so this is my first week like trying to get back into it it's like the last week of August we're just freaking me out cuz I mean it's always like my birthday and then the end of summer and then Christmas birthdays man birthdays today I've gotta shoot I have meeting and then I've got Bowden thing it's a like I'm gonna be on their customer panels I'm gonna be filmed talking about Bowden I've just added sort of park my reflective choice because I'm just not quite sure you know what I want to include like how deep I want to go cuz I feel like I need to go back to the start of my twenties and I was obviously quite insecure about a lot of things you know you probably probably yes I'm a late bloomer so I was very much insecure the age of 20 about that I've got an excerpt from my diary at like 19 and I was gonna include that it was like 10 things I've realised age 20 and five those things all related to one guy and I guess you know my 20s you know I thought you know I thought I might fall in love but now I kind of realize apparently I don't send signals out I'm available it's in like I said no signals out and it's is really cuz I'm just I'm quite shy I you know I'm quite I just want to protect myself in a way like I wanted to settle for might refer to it cuz I knew if you know if I'd if at 20 I'd felt if someone has just said you know you're not weird you know what if are a lot better about myself because you think that everyone's like super experienced that everything I didn't you know did they you know it got really down I'd get really down so I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure how how much you want to talk about but I just know if you're young and you're insecure it's okay like a potato cleared face potato it's gonna be the busiest time of year September October November cuz it's gonna be lots of Christmas campaigns and Browns wanna like get the awareness out there before Christmas this is a really important time of year it's gonna be a week it's like make or break I guess because if it goes really well I'll be like you know great I feel really confident for 2018 and if it doesn't you know there'll be lots to learn from and bring forward cuz every year I'm just like you know is this my last year of this right do I have to stop chose to do something else but then something always happens it makes me think no keep going next year will be my 10th year of blogging so I have lots of like interesting reflections and I go really talk about how it's how everything like evolved each year you know when you're like I really want to do I should I I don't really have time but I've already started so now just got go with it mmm I think that's like the main update I mean sometimes I freak out like when I wasn't saying well every so often I'd be like I need to freeze my eggs like right now calm down okay I think I'm just gonna enjoy being 30 you know 30 I did it sound so weird why why Volare 30 I'm

hello so that push which was me making my bed at 5:00 p.m. because I have had the laziest Saturday in history of Saturday's like it's ridiculous like that September and it's like January September is the January fashion everyone want some fresh start it's like back to school isn't it and everyone panics cuz it's almost the end of the year you know it's a very busy period especially for us internet bulk so I guess yeah I do want to have some new systems in place I don't know what the systems are if you can help with my systems yeah I do want to get a bit more consistent so maybe not Toba I might set myself a challenge try do two videos a week I was thinking of doing a week of videos but it might be better just spreading out the same amount of videos over the month and it will stress me out less but it gives me a chance to see what it's like you know creating two videos so I will start prepping for that like I guess now start like planning so if you've got anything you'd like to see me do let me know and I will you know I have a little have a go and I someone asked me for a books video is taking me like a year to read like five books so it's it's coming it's on the back burner but it will happen when I can read these books I just said and it's a hard cuz I'm online all the time I feel good though I know I was I was freaking out about turning 30 I feel good I feel like I know myself better I feel more confident even though I'm not like super confident you know confidence is a journey I feel like I can project confidence and I think it is about faking it til you make it so I do tend to project confidence even if I'm not very confident in certain situations so yeah I feel like it's just a chance to get myself together and in so many different ways it everything is good you know apart from the state of the world but you know everything in you know things in my life are good so yeah that's my little update for you so thank you so much for watching this vlog I know it was I don't know I don't know what this is but thank you so much for watching and all of your lovely comments I've also got a blog I want you to know so I just posted the stuff that I shot two days ago on my blog so I'd love it if you checked it out I've also got Instagram I'm always posting colorful photos and you know food London travel whatever I can get my hands on basically that's all the plugging I've got my top commenter goes to Miss Nude or ninety who's been really nice leaving lots of comments on my videos thank you so much it's appreciated definitely and yeah I think that's it for now so especially give this a thumbs up a comment all that jazz and I will see you very very soon bye but the weirdest look is probably the trilby spotty skirt cardigan like broke kneehigh socks tights combination like it's the most bizarre thing I did I feel like as playing character resort some days I think every blogger had a peter pan collar stage a lot of Topshop I spent a lot of money

AMR has built those today built them put them together but we just need to sort of work out where they're going to go and it's got dark outside so I can't do my videos so I thought don't just use the time in a productive way I was gonna cave in and have dominates night but mr.

I never try the Kylie Jenner new lipsticks but if you like this looks like is it Dolce okay that one I feel like it looks like him do you want to know I have on I know you do okay so basically what I have on first of all stripped down by Mac which is always my base for nude lip I always put this lip liner i line my lips and I filled them in and then I used um Inglot lipstick the nude 14.4 and 4:04 sorry which looks like ah it's basically the same color as naturally transformed but it's just a bit more matte it's basically a very nude nude so if I went somewhere on its own it just I just look like a ghost so because it kind of cancels out my lips and I don't have lips looks very identical to naturally transformed but this is just a bit more like not Matt anyway so I'll put look at that on top and then I went in with a very very small amount of very small amount of one of these Brown concealers but very very small enough you don't want to put too much as I just gonna be bound yeah I

desert lounge and I have like been there I've known the owner for quite a while and I wanted something to do in the time before now in Nigeria like part time other than doing my YouTube and whatever

blog cheering so you guys will be seeing me doing things fast hand like I've never done before and experiencing very different things like I've never done before so I hope you're going to enjoy that I

change of plan I'm not going to be spending my evening editing we are going to go for Chinese with our friends which actually I'm so excited about I haven't seen them all together in ages and it was my best friend Carrie's birthday the other day so I've got to give her her present and yeah I get to see them all oh this is so exciting but I have to go redo my hair now that I've put up and maybe my makeup team although I'm really loving this Charlotte Tilbury foundation it's quite drying so the fact that I forgot to put my lush million dollar moisturizer underneath I'm really sort of like uh noticing that my skin is quite quite dry but it stays in place so well it's really really nice actually I wasn't really that hopeful for it but I also thought there's a girl who got my colour completely wrong because she was literally like just put it on my face like henna yeah perfect I thought you haven't looked at that right but she had fair play to the girl in Selfridges she was very lovely but yeah I thought she's got it wrong and she hasn't yeah so I should probably go and get ready just sat here going over some changes on my new site and Annie bought me hot chocolate it's not coffee and it got a little hot tuna I'm so impressed with how good that art is I can't even do that this is like my favorite part of the evening when he brings me hot chocolate it makes me really happy so this is what I'm wearing tonight to the restaurant I know I'm not wearing my bevery trends but it is still Burberry I am so wearing a Burberry coat this is what I'm wearing in tonight I pruned it yeah they're in Stoney Stratford I've got Carrie's present jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way so we back from the meal and we has such a good night it's always such a good time we go and have dinner we went and had Chinese and just kind of like a pre New Year's celebration but now we're home and I think Ali's about to go to bed I am downstairs watching 24 hours in earnest and

vlog there really because I thought I'd get anything that's ready to go out tomorrow so I'll see you tomorrow bye bye man hey bye all right don't"	1432
"no_WARDROBE CLEANSE & SHOP  Lily Pebbles.txt"	"hi everyone today's video is going to be a little bit different to me because I haven't really got a plan of how this is going to go and I'm kind of just winging it it's not a blog and it's not a fancy planned out kind of main videos I think this one's going to sit somewhere in between and the reason for this is because today's video is about something I was kind of just going to do offcamera and then I thought wait a minute you guys would probably be interested in this but let me chat through the idea and maybe what you can expect from this video my friend Deb I've known her since I was three she has always been very into style very in fashion and I've always had gone to her for advice I have my own personal style and we getting her things that we think differently about she's quite daring with her style but whenever I'm in a changing room and I need advice she is always the person I'll send the photos to and say yes or no and I will listen to what she says she's kind of worked in and out of fashion for a long time so although at the moment that's not her fulltime job I often go to her for styling advice recently I found myself in a bit of a style rut I feel like I really know what I like much more than I have any other point in my life but because of the situation and how small my wardrobe is I feel like I need to have better quality things and maybe less of them and all that said one minute as I was saying I feel like I need better quality stuff that I know goes together like proper outfit because often I'll think oh I don't have anything to wear and I'll go online I'll order something really like adventurous and daring and then I just won't know how to wear it so I wanted dad to come over and kind of analyze my wardrobe as it is help me make outfit out of the things I already have and then write a list of things I need that I'm really missing in my wardrobe so she came over on the weekend and we kind of fit that but what I'm going to do is run through with you guys now what we have discussed then I'll show you my wardrobe I actually got I think two or three outfits out suppose I already have I wouldn't necessarily already where so I'm really happy with that and then we made like a really clear list of things that we want to go by so I am in my wardrobe that makes it sound like I have a wardrobe room it's literally just an open wardrobe and I'm going to show you the situation as it is now over here we have dresses and trousers so I've got a few like really smart dresses that's fine I've got this a sauce jumper dress so I tried on again actually quite like and then I've got a few trousers and skirts over here I've got lots of jumpers lots of knitwear and a couple of shirts I think what we realized is I have a lot of casual jumpers and tshirts because that's mainly what I wear all the time but then if I need to go out somewhere I don't really know how to have like a smart casual outfit that's not like a dress but it's not a jumper in jeans it's somewhere in the middle and that's really what I wanted to get more of so I'm going to show you the outfits that Deb's picked out from my wardrobe like things I can already wear okay let me show you my shoe situation I have these from Topshop which I absolutely love because they're so comfy I can literally run in them but because they're kind of suede they've really really scratched so I'm considering buying replacement if they do things like this I wore them at the weekend forgot how much I love them so if I can't find a replacement I'm deafening to keep these these aren't jigsaws they're my Telsey boot style and love where needs of jeans these are the only heels I own which is really annoying because they're very kind of strappy I have to have painted toes and I wear them lots of like foot exposed so if I can I really want to find a pair of closed toe heels but I really struggle to find some that fit me because I'm a halfsize so we will see but that's something I definitely need and these are my black boots which are from Topshop they're sock boots they do got really high so I find some things I can't wear them but I really like them I really want to add a pair of over the knee boots I think over the knee boots could look really nice with the jumper dress or skirt so you want more skirts in my wardrobe and maybe with jeans as well I think I need to find the right ones that have a little bit of a heel not too high and not too flattering like riding boots so that something's on the list as well this is absolute one which deficit together for me from my existing wardrobe this shirts from Lillian Lionel and I usually wear this untucked with jeans but I'm not very good at touching things in she told me cut these into these black trousers I have from Zara I'm sorry is that this journey mirror I have in my flats it's not great but they're kind of just like workhouses and I'm wearing them with the Topshop boots and that's quite a nice smart ish outfit to wear this is outfit number 2 and the skirt I actually bought this in Amsterdam and I haven't worn it because I just didn't really know how dad told me to pair it with my Topshop stock boots which I really like and this a soft thin knit slightly high neck tops that I have said a statement necklace would be great so I break this up so that's on my list of things to get but I really like this outfit and I really never would have thought of wearing it but now I put it on I really like it so those are two outfits that we picked out from the toads I already have things that are normally wear but really like and there's lots of other outfits I can wear but we also went through made a list of things I need to get we basically sat down together and went on a source I'm sorry I didn't film that but it was on the weekend and we didn't really know we were going to film this yet you ordered a load of stuff and I thought I should film me trying on the things Deb's hasn't seen anything yet so it would be really interesting to hear her feedback I've got a few tops a couple of jumpsuit I kind of went crazy and I personally love pretty much all the stuff normally when I would have mace this is so much stuff that I send back but I think because I add depth helping me we ordered some really cool stuff there's a leather skirt as well which I'm not sure about so I'm going to start trying things on and showing both of you okay so this is all the ace of stuff so I start with the jumpsuit we got two jumpsuits one song with swords and long form know something ephemeral exid femme one's a bit more casual one's a bit more small so it's um a dumped suit very nice yeah yeah I love it so flattering this is the mia frill jumpsuit from whistles I think a lot of people have this there's like some frills here's the cold shoulder thing which I like because I eat without this I wouldn't like it as much although it's slightly hold tight which I like quite tight on the boobs I don't love showing off my boobs but if you take it kind of go down it's looser at the bottom and it's got this pleat here which i think is quite flattering it's got a hole in the back so most of it is what it is that's the rack I think I definitely keep this if it's good for smart events which shoes would over with it the problem I always have is what shoes to wear this is what the Topshop boots look like with it and I think they look cool and I think I could wear like strappy heels if I want to make it really small it was not an award to my wedding this is the selected FEM jumpsuit which I was just saying is less scary to me cuz I feel like it's quite casual like to wear a trainers and be quite likes candy you like it yes and you suppose I was wrong as well really let me show you guys this is the jumpsuit from selected foam I love it it's got pockets I love it it's like tshirt style and it's in this kind of thick worms and materials and cold and it's kind of all now on to the lettuce coat which is the one I know it's going to divide me in Deb's because as I said earlier I feel like I'm Way more into like comfort yourself dressed like comfy but if something looks great your sacrifice like being a bit uncomfortable because it looks good not fair well no maybe it's not these neuroses it's like I just am more fussy yeah how comfy something is so I've got this leather skirt on which I think looks great I'm worried that if I keep it I won't wear it because I feel like I like can't walk and it's a bit tight I'm going to tend to love it obviously one minute oh no Kong cops turn and hey the way this is a whistles top which we ordered it's actually kind of faded Navy stripes but I really like the long sleeves you at the top I see the top that's really cool and it's a little bit shorter but easy to tuck into things which I like so I might be look saggy I'm wearing a strapless bra fit it's a skirt I like it I just don't know like I don't I can't really walk I tell you what look like when I sit down there one minute this is kind of what it looks like from afar I really like it I'm just worried that I should maybe get one that's shorter and I can also wear it over the knee boots if I get them yes like when I sit I don't think I'll be have to eat in it yes I don't know I think that's a maybe and we'll see what we find one out today we also ordered this you fare I ordered this so the only thing I really don't like is the thing that I picked it's a long sleeve babe pink top that crosses over and I really love how it reminds me of ballet can we and edited ballet together when we were three but it's just so cropped that the only thing I could wear it with is this leather skirt and I don't know if I'm going to keep that so I think Deb said there's something similar in top shot that's a bit longer so I think I'm going to send this on back another thing we had a manís is a body which I've never really thought about getting before but I like the idea of it like being you'd have to worry about tucking it in so this one is some selected firm is what the sheer arms is like polka dots and then black vest built in and it's not back to us which I like and I just tucked into black jeans which some reason look like they're bulging open these are from Topshop for have these on the bottom I like it a little bit like my favorite thing because this V I don't know if it's my favorite thing I really like it like that's great I think it dude wanted to have quite handy in case I like had a skirt I want to tuck it into another maybe depends how we get on today this is a top from I don't know I'll link everything that we talked about below in the description box I love the color it's like whisper pink which I'm really into at the moment and it comes in black too apparently the next line is different from me and the length let me show you it's actually quite a clever top because it looks like I've touched it in so actually it's just that's the link which is really handy because then you don't have to worry about talking things in I don't normally wear like a low V like this I like it and I think the links are the arms very flattering oh my god I sort of what's that age where I start wearing tops with arms this length I haven't hopefully but yeah I think it's nice it looks really nice with black jeans great for events when I want to be a little bit smart but not too small it is a really good find actually and different other things I have in my wardrobe there's pretty happy about this one and you can wear it with that necklace oh yeah but like a long necklace and by Ilana this is a high neck gray jump that I had like detailing on the bottom so it looks like this it's got quite a high neck which I think I could roll down once if I wanted to that allowed us okay so it's got this like frilly detail which i think is very cute and flattering and death said I have to roll the sleeve up so I would do that I feel so knit great need to buy new bras today I think this is quite cute or top this top I already know I love I tried it on and it's great some whistles it's got this cute pearl detail coldshoulder it's fitted it mazey I really really like this I just love everything from whistles basically so that's all the stuff from Asus really happy with it a couple of things not sure about but me and ever going to go out today to town love grains town a weekday and we're going to try and lots of stuff we written a list I think that's pretty important when doing so nervous I put over the knee boots spin out about those I don't really want to invest in the Stuart Weitzman's ones yet I don't know if I'm going to wear them all the time so it's going to list it although I think skirts may be trying to leather skirts maybe some other like shorter skirts I can wear a big jumpers with I really want to be a boy hat but they're pretty hard to find I felt like a lot of them are quite high up I feed to my friend Carrie yesterday she said she got heard from a random hat website so we'll see what we find maybe a nice jumper dress if I get the high knee boots high knee boots we have a kneehigh boots smart top so don't so I need that many but we're going to look maybe trying like pajama fella called Raja so every I could never the Lillian line one yes exactly crops sweaters statement necklace that might be hard to find bras I mean if I have the patience and if I make it down to Selfridges I hate bra shopping they're so expensive but I need a good bra that were like lift these babies up leather trousers we need to add that like leather looks yeah faux leather trousers really want some of those I think they like Deb's wearing some today she's always wearing them and I think they're really useful replace Topshop chunky boots might have a look for those belts for jeans statement yeah that's she could be any belt I have is like a cowboy style belt I want in a weekend and it really didn't go with the top I was wearing so something a bit easier to wear and that's kind of everything I know it sounds like a lot and I feel like I'm going to spend a lot of money but I think what they do this I'll be sorted for a while good staples next step is to head into town we've got a list of things to buy I'm going to bring you guys along with us and I'll see you when we get there we're in our zone dad's just said you're very giddy uppy thumbs up how I shop these are some opening boots who found they've got a little bit of a heel which I like my worry is that they don't do up at the back of got very skinny legs you'll try I think I need some that I can tighten like wire them on jeans or I can wear them bare leg I'm going to turn over new boot and also on heels as well thank you so these are the boot my only concern is that they're going to slip down when I walk some and they have a low wall front shot that's always how I test out this is the feet actually fit me I think I tried these on but because they are pointy my toes is a codpiece pocket I really like these but I think they'll sit down and drive me mad so I'm going to have lots of Browns as you are there is we're in office and they have some over the knee boots and have ties on the back I'm going to years ago so these boots have a little try on the back there look at the pointy ER than the ones from Aldo but I bought tiny bit of a heel this is what the suit looks like on little bit like slimmer than the other ones they're not baggy sorry the music so now they're put these on hold maybe transfers to it works or one fish I know or like the ultimate boot feels like and I can confess about I'm also going to try these on Pelican leather version of the ones I have they won't stop this easily you're in popstar cat necklaces and clothes there's a lot of stuff in there Deb has been distracted by the stretcher and very secure I told you guys this video is experimental and it's proving hard like film our little conversations but we're able to promote the well there's lots of fealty and I want ones where's Jean so it's supposed to into this one in a mediums large like a textured leather like a faux snake skin up a mane yeah lot from yeah and then it's a small small in the spinner belts where with high waisted things about kind of what we've decided is like good to belts have in wardrobe there's new tactic is to just take things up so that we see you position to be like they've been aged everything was brown and leather skirt if you know so Brown well but see what you pick up for me I'm still talking on to belches well like I mean a lot of clothes and I hand you manage to get a room in the top shots personal styling area which was amazing if you can try on all the stuff take our time and I can possibly show you guys everything trying on we are in the changing rooms by the way stop shop metal styling is amazing just pay for it you just pay for we buy genius here we have the to belt I showed you guys we have some jeans which are the Hayden jeans what I hate is jeans I like then I do highways boots area like a very nice that I can actually fit you can pull my legs but that wasn't why they give is a Loutre they're in a little bit we have this floral shirt short great jumpers attached to address an orange jumper I will not wear this but it okay I hate the material and I hate the color yellow jumper with frills I picked that I like that leather skirt got shorter than the one I got from a sauce we're going to give it a go Jarman style shirt can you tell it desert try to get me to wear more colors black top with like cool sleeve black and white top again with course leaves evident for crazy sleeves and then these leather trousers in a light gray just to see men Deb Scott's and saw strands or else these are the jeans I wasn't expecting to buy jeans today but these are pretty cool actually because they kind of go straight down the all my other genes either with you back you'll be tightened they're just a different fit this jumper I actually like the kids it's got baggy arms which make my jumpers that have fat what about things that wing and it's cropped one or two cropped maybe they have a really nice yeah this is cool this is a top which I'm not going to get so I'll show you guys because it's so short I've got big boobs a little bit of tummy it doesn't really flutter it's kind of mealy they're not quite rightly very colors when the prints yeah nice shape here good night participant this is the leather skirt and I really like it actually I think I'll get more use out of this length than the long one and lots of you all we have pocket why isn't it always more fun to manage pocket always we like the top and I like to see the stuff but we don't think yellow suits me and I think this might come and blush pink that said this is the kind of pajama style shirt which I think I quite like yes it is going to get another size and something I'm going to wait to see what sheathing I like the prin and I kind of like the link I think it works with the skirt as well something I've learned from this whole shopping experience that I need to get used to just try on a size 10 I would try a and a 12 because I like things a bit oversized but I think most the time attend more flattering in my head I'm not a 10 I'm a 12 this is the top Innis of blush pink and it's cute you know like I'm not messing into this pile of the speeds I kind of wish you didn't have that yeah I think it's a good one to have when I'm wearing highwaisted everything's pink in my wardrobe we're not going to get there but we've agreed that we love the gray with the pink and also the idea of a cropped Jean forward skirt it is that this one as you can see it kind of falls there it for me and you see a bit higher through fluttering so it's not quite right this is the way of top with like the crazy arms it's quite like fashion II yeah but it's quite like loose around the neck and a Housefull about this one scratcher here we're done with the clothes I'll show you what I'm going to get you said nose quickly things over there things I liked with the jeans the leather skirt the pajama shirt the pink jumper you nervous about that one I think I like it and the orange jumper we just went into Stuart Weitzman's I'm gonna try them on I actually thought it'd be about how short and collide and they were now Harlan sidekick now they were beautiful so comfortable they do have sizes a little why are the two rounds don't you have sizes certainly does the designer thing now so they finished gloves and I absolutely love it I just can't be most have to spend that much on Sue's like they're going to get fluffy they're going to get so on the floor and yeah I can't believe this 664 hours oh and I so na they were few so that's not fixin to come home I'm just an elk a Bennett and dead that's coming here because their shoes look really completed as you dry I think I may have found some heels in closed toe and wraparound and not too high so I like that they're closed toe and they kind of to move my other ones actually and not too high and actually pointing you can really like them they're which is offensive but I feel like good to have like one I mean I try to sell Chloe worth of fortune because has a good pair of heels I think I really like them they're not too high and they've got this point which makes it really flattering I think they are great get find them so it's always the places you least expect it what are the chances that was such a success okay Bennett and if you have sizes so I've got six and a half which is really helpful so nice I've got to the point where it's all a bit thick how its money I prefer but I did just say to dead or normally happens is all get invited something whatever anything's worse and I'll panic and I'll panic by something stupid and then I'll be rubbish so although it's painful spending it all now at least I know then I'll have a good wardrobe I can just like use whenever I come to the self just to gallery and come back to office and tried on over new foods again and they're reduced from 120 to 60 the gloves I'm going to get over the newbie I might as well I mean it's better than 660 i thing is the nice ones I've tried on so far but if they're quite tight on my leg and then slightly pointed it off I think I'm going to get them we're now going to head back home because the second part of it that I need to get rid of enclosed whenever I needed us I'm going to get rid of stuff because I haven't got room so I'm going to go through and anything that I don't wear I'm going to give to charity or my sisters or friends with back home and now after buying all the things today we have like a fresh look on some of those a sauce maybe items so I'm definitely going to send back to the body I'm also going to send backs a little pink crop top to skirt because we found a shorter leather skirt that I think I'll get more wear out of now what we need to do is make room for the new thing so there's four aces items there and we get a bit I got two shoes and I think I'm definitely gonna have to choose I can get rid of right now I need to find something to switch out I'm currently going through the straw and it's a charity stuff and this is keep I've got rid of a lot of stuff I just don't wear I don't need and when I put things back in I folded them like this so I can see everything for these autumn a tshirt desktop strappy tops I've got my no makeup day and lunch at a live jumper and a few longsleeved top I'm also going to see if I can put any of these things in drawers this guy is example of 100 items so I bought this plot and I loved them but the day I wore them it was hot and in the summer I had a meeting and when I stood up for the meeting I was so sweaty I'm one of the people that sweats on my legs sorry that's gross but you could see the sweat marks and now I'm just too scared to wear them and Dez is right you shouldn't really have things in your wardrobe you're not going to wear because every time I look at them I just feel guilty that I bought them and only wore them once but too scared to like risk the sweaty thing happening again so these are going to go in the bag I have filled two bags worth of stuff to give to charity I give to a shop called crisis which is a charity for homeless people I was just saying how I think most people cleanse their wardrobe and then go shopping but I actually really like doing it this way around we kind of assess the Wardrobe shopped and then Deb's made a really good point that now I've got all these nice new things I can be bit more like ruthless and I know what I want to get rid of why I don't and I'm just kind of going by the rule of have I worn it recently and there's a lot of things which I feel like I love I feel guilty because maybe I haven't worn them as much as I wanted to I didn't wear them so what's the point someone else can enjoy them for a huge bag of stuff here a huge bag of stuff here I'm getting rid of way more stuff than I thought so I feel good about that look how many free honee they have and also so much more space in my wardrobe so I'm now going to put all the new things in there we've sorted out my wardrobe now and I think I'm going to leave my shoes and coats to do another day or maybe tonight when I come back here I'm going to drop Deb's home but I feel like I've got a brand new wardrobe and it's so nice to have got rid of so much stuff and have some like pretty new stuff in look it's quite a bit of color going on and like you can tell the similarities like that blues in that got a bit of pink got a bit of a hoarder tinge so more stripes of course but look how much space I have and my drawers are all like tidy now and I'm really looking forward to taking these to the charity shop as well I've got my new shoes there I need to spray with the suede protector and then I'm going to sort my shoes in a bit thanks for y'all hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm going to link every item that I bought and

you to find girl we by the way don't judge me I've aged well I think I mean I look like I was clearly heavily pregnant it's just the face it's just the hair it's just everything about this picture I don't know why I thought this was okay this is by the way Lauren Luke I was obsessed with in love and still think she's amazing but I just okay yeah this is my personal facebook this is what happened when I was 8 months pregnant Darcy and I decided to go for a style chick and I thought this was a really sexy picture that I've taken and I sent it I took it on my like old Kodak and I sent it to Zoey like if you're zoella if you don't know me to edit for me it's just like I've edited really sexy to me sexy for me okay oh my god oh no that's just me giving birth are you ready okay here we go don't

Doudna because this is someone that I've got Oh monkey this Isis I'm gonna see how it fits good morning yes I slept in my Baker's last night we've woken up to discover that the shower in a bedroom ensuite has leaked down into the kitchen can't use that to the cat has leaked in the kitchen and pissed on the blanket we have on the sofa so it's a really great start to the day lovely lovely breakfast this is Marmite and look at the finger what God is so excited to eat all of this I feel like I've already achieved so much today I've had my nails done this color in the salon I was like I won't get that color that's a really trashy red and then Chloe was like that's the color I always get and the woman behind me was like I getting that color too and I was like I'll have trashy red actually quite like it comes to my lips a little bit and I've taken Darcy picture that's I have sorted out and like really boring people like admin stuff and now I think I'm gonna go and record a main Channel video it's 20 plus 11 I'm getting my hair done Olli was going to specialist at home film then I'm gonna get my hair done Vicky's popped over shut hello Vicky shut up just shut hello to the camera there we go okay and she just had a hypo which sounds really exciting I can't come in because I've got all my stuff on the wall but it's not is it what's the hypo if you're diabetic what could have what's the worst that could happen with that just casual coma we avoided coma though so that's good and yeah that's where we're up to oh I'm going to have some cold pizza at halfpast eleven decadent top for me really nice little like you know when the good things happen this kind of thing you know ages ago I did that video with all of Darcy's awesome clothes in it and lots of it come from Jules well Jules also asked if I wanted to get something for a friend and so I got Mickey this little like Kate coat nice so look at the detail that is I don't let me stop my camera oh you've got em you need to pick the stuff off the buttons I'll let you do this because I'm gonna I don't think then it'll like brassy golden buttons very nice Swiss round dad I know you're not focused no well that's so nice what is it like done I really like factually lovely and then the trip black how happy are you with a free Cape Vicki oh my sweater self oh very nice okay really go so it'd be summer out there good morning it's Thursday and I have a rare day off not a whole lot of stuff going on today I've just got like stuff to do at home so I thought I ought to tackle dressingroom it's gotten a massive State again like I'm incapable of keeping this room tidy but we're going to have to do when the baby comes because the baby is gonna like half half of this room we're gonna separate here where the wardrobes end and all of this space that we'll show you later I'm just turn the TV down it's very loud all of that space we're going to turn into baby's room there we go I'll show you what it looks like from this angle so yeah as you can see here to here it's gonna cordon off and then all of this will be their room some people might think was a bit strange because they don't have a door and it just like leads into our space but I quite like it because I want her to be near us for a while as she gets older obviously she'll have her own room with a door and previously it's all that kind of stuff but for the first few months definitely she's gonna be sleeping like fully in there with us and then I would say for the first year or two probably in here anyway it's a shit tip as always so I thought what I do is with speed tidying usually a prop my laptop just here on the windowsill and just like cycle through vlogs and stuff so don't know if I'll do that or if I'll put the TV back on I'll do that because I want to put the TV on when it's this morning cuz call out this morning but for now it's only about 9 o'clock so I shall put on some vlogs and speak clean and hope that you enjoyed that I loved watching speak any videos I'm not fully finished but I've put away most of the massive piles of stuff of silver I'll do that little pile down there and there's a few bits down there but nothing major so glad ago all that then I had to cut those out of it because bloody Liam came in started ironing without his top on I was like Liam get out of shorty was like it's my drastic world was like no no it's not your dressing room my life is only to be lived to be filmed and if you can't be in it then you can't be in my life um that took a weird turn I wasn't that severe but who's just think thinking these things anyway what I picked up my camera to tell you was these are shoe racks and I think they're really stupid things enough just that for me I don't have that many shoes what I do I have a lot of shoes but they're not precious shoes they're like Primark or newlook shoes and I'm not really one for like designer shoes or really designer bags I've got three capes bait bags they're my designer bags but I don't like wet my knickers over a pair of Jimmy Choos I couldn't give a shit to be honest but what I would rather have is space to put things like this is Darcy's memory box should I go through that one day it's cute I'm like stuff places so Liam was like don't do this yourself heel balls it up well Liam I can do whatever och um so I'm gonna go find his tool kit and see if I can get these off what are you are you tools while you're a screwdriver yeah that'll do I've won the first battle Oh I've just gotten all the way upstairs in the doghouse God really hoping it's my yours order because I ordered some jeans but I think it's really boring printer ink it was printer egg this is as high as my tripod will go I think you can see that these here I need to pick these off but my nails won't let me do it so I'm going to use the screwdriver and then I'm going to unpick get this whole stuff off it's not as easy as I had anticipated it to be but I won't be defeated don't do it why are you so hard to get off yes little bitch bag yes yes yes our feeling so proud of myself today I have got done so much that I need you to get done who feels pretty good I've done a bit of cleaning I've done some writing not as much as I would have liked but still a good amount I've filmed edited a video now I'm going to clean my makeup brushes and sponges because they are minging I'm mainly cleaning real technique brushes because they're the ones I mainly use to say the best look how filthy they all are I'm gonna be using happy hippie from lush I have one of these Sigma things that you like rub them on I've got some there to do as well and then this is my little lay them down set up just been a demo one really dirty one so that you can enjoy my satisfying ear so I give it a little wet and then I get it on the cleaning stuff and then if it's a reader you wanna call me big bubbles there's probably a better way to do this but essentially I'm just sort of scrubbing it on this I don't feel too bad because what I've been doing every day to the brochures I probably should do it every day but that's not how I rock and roll baby I just want to rub dirty brushes all over my face yes please rubbing that bacteria into my pores yummy and then when it's not like producing any more yuck there's gonna be so many people being like that's not how you dairy a snooping around and I just pop it over here and then I like squeeze them all out when I'm done and this one's not too bad oh so satisfying that bit when you see it all come out yes goodbye filthy dirt this thingamabob II was amazing it's the first I've used it and I got all of these done in not much time at all I watched two vlogs I like minutes got all of those done literally so impressed with that I will find one for you it's got a scent that I've here box I'll fumble for you and link it below for you if you want one I was planning on just having a bit of a relax now because it's about 6:00 and thing and going out for dinner shortly my friend and I were going to there's only if which is like my favorite tapas place ever but then Liam Reilly's how could I bring his rugby kit to work because he's going to the he's going to lads and dad's rugby tonight which is like some of the dads from Darcy's school and lads as well because I would see English it no Liam is not Darcy's dad but he's his losses lad basically just a bunch of friends going play rugby in a village near here but he forgot his kit so I need to find a top to work oh it's very dark feely dog need to find like a little toppy thing to put on with leggings to be comfy because I want to eat a lot but also it's very hot in that restaurant people just go for a little cardigan and peace and bollocks dropped all the hangers in a bid to jazz up what is essentially just leggings and a vest top and a cardigan I've like put this belt round it I can't decide if it looks shit or if it looks alright I'm going out like this so hopefully all right one of these would be good thank you thanks I forgot to film when it was all like fresh and pristine but these are pod room peppers and leave my favorite schrieffer's delicious you've got mushroom Easter and that was a steak over here is like no no no no no no one do that like horns with their heads on tortilla everything delicious are you enjoying it

if he's got for dinner with Emma so that was really really lovely just to go and do that the cat the cat is like brushing on my feet hanging out baby you know you might be filmed say hi everybody lots of human asking we found his brother no is the answer sadly Azula has not returned we have just rocket and I think probably I mean it's been about six several weeks now I think that Sudha has found a new home I'm hoping it's not in kitty heaven and he's just found like I love the old lady that cuddles him all day long but the reality is we are in a more countryside environment than the way at the old place and maybe it's a fox or sort of thing I'm trying not to think that I've taught Darcy that it's just found he's just found another home so she seems to be okay with wasn't that idea I don't think she'd be okay if I was like yeah a fox and in fact tomorrow I'm going to go and look at kittens and one of my friends mums cats had kittens and and the need I need homes she doesn't breathe them I don't think I think her cat just had kittens so I'm gonna go see about maybe adopting good morning it's Friday Friday we are going to go see they come mentioned it yesterday a friend of mine mum cat had kittens and they need rehoming okay hello and to get my hand back for me thank you so we are going to nip out now and just say hello to my friends kittens aren't we no okay been a busy morning

is just unbelievable comment down below if you know she is you not years and I don't know and then that led us to search in zoella on their equivalent of Twitter which is called Weibo and people were like tweeting pictures of Zoe's burg and stuff like that and then we just clicked a link to doh or to do or something like that and here's one of those videos sorry come look at this I left there's a

yesterday but that is the remains oh oh my god the lights in here Oh crazy his owe me dinner which was delicious but now we are about to have a bath which is a little bit scary because you know what happened yesterday when I had a bath drop my phone in there so today not gonna be taking part I was really in the Bott not gonna be taking my phone into the bottle for me I'm off coming now guys I've been coming in ages be now my friend or late you guys all know him he's been in loads of blogs before it's his 21st birthday so at me and che and Holly and Stuart and Louis we're all gonna go clubbing so I just go chain to action of them actually going clubbing because I don't really feel like drinking and all that I'm quite tired but it's just 21st birthday so at least I want to go and have some drinks with him and we'll just see what happens so let's go chase waiting outside in the taxi no honey you're not come in I'm sorry you can you're gonna hang out with mommy over there you know what's annoying guys when everyone agrees to meet somewhere between nine and half past nine the king and queen park means how you get there a little bit late quarter to 10: we're very sorry guys for 15 minutes late oh wait nobody is there everyone is still at Ali's house which is like minute walk away we just do half responsible press so now what do we do we're like we thought we were 15 minutes

so we need to go get some cash out maybe good beef we get some food let's be real Olli and everyone how many people are there like 15 everyone is Ali's house basically and they don't want to get a

"no_We've changed.txt"	"I'm going down down you ever I've got a break on 30 but I've got a drink oh yeah I got that all like you know I've got a yeah ah me fella hello darlings it's reading a few of the comments apparently uh we've changed how many were incredibly unrelatable now I'm already missing my like mum friends from London we were really lucky that we had a really like good group of like four or five mum friends that were like in the immediate area so it would be really easy to just meet in the park in five minutes or they'd come around when it was raining or whatever the kids all got on and we've got on and yeah I just kind of like that's probably going to be the thing I miss the most so I'm really keen to meet new people and for grayton to make new friends as well I think it's really important for him to have a couple of buddies in the area I am basically mummy no mates at the moment hi everyone ready yes rumors are it is most haunted alleyway in bath we've come for a pizza and Grayson has a salt shaker then I could leave my mature until the day I came back alive I've gotta tell you it's really weird coming back and living here again as a parent because last time I was here our students a completely different set of like priorities and things that I kind of wanted from the city whereas now coming back to the parent it's like we're in veneers softly whereas in a park rather like childfriendly cafes and broke reporters like all bars and so you keep the wind song Gracie and I are going to go and try out on these soft play now and in London see you later you let go no part of softly okay wish us luck making fun you look I've had to come back to the house to pick up a few extra loose ends and sort some stuff out it's kind of really hit me now walking into this place I'm just seeing an empty like this it's it it's an odd feeling it's desired I thought about this place I said a couple of weeks ago but like I can almost I can almost hear everything that ever happened in here you only have to flashback a few months in this place is just fill up and Grayson's coming up the stairs after his day in the park and the TV was on and Hannah was in the kitchen pottering around and I'm upstairs to steal my editing then it's just got this quietness to it now it's odd quietness the funny thing is it feels small I thought when we emptied all of our stuff out of it it would look huge but it doesn't it feels a lot smaller I remember bringing a bath grace in here and just sitting on the sofa with in there and just having him on my knees and and I was in bed sleep and les is looking at the tiny baby that we just brought back and just thinking oh my god what we done we can make this little human always going to do with it as we're just falling so Melford them right there why this house is so important for happens because this is really where I first learned how to be happy it's like coming back to see an old friends that they're not sailing me I'm a really lovely place the other mums are so so friendly here I couldn't get over it like everyone wants to chat and they're just so welcoming and so lovely I was just kind of chatting away while Grayson was playing really he had a great time he did lots of fancy just didn't you little one yeah lots of fun suggests that it was just very nice so we'll definitely be going back to that play griff and everyone's so helpful in like telling me which play groups to go to in which areas to go to and stuff so I'm so so glad that we went back from London it's been doing some editing and I need to go out now and get some dessert because we have a couple of friends coming over tonight so people yeah psychotic Oh fuzzy wins the most premier upper 1220 why is good okay how does like footage just getting downstairs on the right this view is crazy makes me feel like oh fuck is wrong so I see there's an energy you keep seeing Nick at this commute for hours then I start to get to the power our graduation he'll be like everything that leads a half an hour or not get bored two months that's all it is isn't it yeah two months they'll go so quickly yeah well wonderful dinner like so colleagues as well great and did it like a place in the moon it makes other yeah good round face and it's apples had fat rolls remember when he had known and because he was so far Krista specific moving house is a quite argue Asst that in comparison to like having a new baby it's nothing yeah really know your baby's okay hello yes I don't come here as one day life our daddy not as I can so it's not going to be in trouble Harold yeah Thomas is it for Harold Harold Scott's immature love life is much peril his name Harold who dog hollows could be bothering I'm not looking forward to like the first year because I think for a lot of guys I don't want to generalize but for a lot of guys you're just quite bored for the first year because it's not they don't really do anything but now grace is super fun and super fun to play with and I can fight him and wrestle everything like they say a conversation has an amazing but when baby the babies are just like they're just complete idiots they don't have a clue they whoa sometimes they are most ladies on load I see pictures of continued really long time ago when he was like one or like six months old and it still looks like him that it doesn't at the same time like I can't make this change so much like bit more shape on his face now suppose it's Harold Laird you look at sprout why didn't you knit like relaxing up a movie peaceful it's a very good place to come if you are having a bad day it's like a way for the madding crowd isn't it it's one of those it's a bit like how you feel when you go to the beach if you're not feeling very good like it just kind of page ahead a bit not I was having a bad day but I just imagine if I was having no way it would be quite nice up here that's why we nearly moved into knit up there right up that hill with your card going up there I'm right up there near upchuck Jimmy bug but yeah I've started oh wow yeah good so like to literally be other side yeah it's weird some of the see how some people have reacted what's moving here it did take me back a little bit by surprise a few weeks ago when I just weaved in that video then please unsubscribe but I just had to people like you don't because anything about you just dislike just don't watch out I thought that would have purged a lot of them but it seems like the fusions come through and I I you know it's weird I it's a little bit sad I suppose that people feel that you have an agenda or the people feel they feel that you're you know that you're untruthful or or they do think that you're not being honest or something it's like there's no not being I think I personally just felt frustrated because even though you watch somebody on YouTube or you watch like a certain segment of their life or whatever you know what they've chosen to share with you and you never really know what other issues they might be dealing with or like you kind of always got to be quite mindful of the fact that it might get portrayed in a certain way but it's quite often isn't yeah as like rosy as a team yeah for lots of youtubers I think like no one wants to pout really negative confidence so it's just that I think that's important to remember that they might also be dealing with something that they're not sharing or I feel like in life you always have to run at the slowest pace there are a lot of people know if we totally it's obviously too taking appears yeah but a lot of people do too stupid to know they're taking the piss I mean get upset about it so you always have to go too slow to put up so stay tuned light and that's the frustrating thing about it it's like guns are illegal because there's a few mental people out there who will do stupid things with guns but it doesn't mean like if I had a gun I'm not going to go and do anything wrong with them I'll be a responsible gun owner but this is just an example I'm you know those intensive owning a gun but it's just an example of like you've but you ban them because there are idiots out there who would take that gun and do silly things with it it's what I mean so you always have to everything in life has to be engineered around the slowest people and it's the same with YouTube you have to what you say and how you articulate things has to be said in a way that runs at the slowest pace so it's very difficult to actually truly an honesty project one percent of yourself I do feel like sometimes I perfectly won't say things because I I know I plan it not that I can't not that said like backlash like really like protected me but I just can't be able to deal with it I don't know I don't want to waste time like readings shitty comments about myself so I'd rather just not say things in the first place then have to deal with the silly things that will come back from that you know there's a responsibility to sometimes look at something that you said and be like I should leave this in because it is up and if you keep watering yourself down and not ever saying anything with any substance to it or that could offend somebody then you're not really being yourself you've just kind of been you're just moving your mouth and not saying anything I anyway so we go them for a walk yeah but we've got quite pleased quite quickly o builder it is cool possible again yeah we go way up love you come on mama will you be waking up hey great do you want to go to her bed to buy some everyone's them different Democrats around here I did am one of those quizzes that you do online you talk about what your values of what you believe in and I thought it would always be like I would be Labor would be quite likely who I vote for and it turns out I'd be a few composure I'm joking what you get it was there were Democrats yeah it right in yeah I know and then label is active I look forward to exploring fresco I've never let my paintings which are elaborate show along that Union never really like did anything very sculptural it must be really really amazing city how do weekend my friend young with a student there today with him for weekend taxes last year did notice because I know what happened on that week may have met radial and that weekend fun fundraiser Bristol I was out

they always like they have right of way no matter where they're going and it's like actually I'm a car amount of time they screamed at by cyclists with sponsorship isn't handling a lot on the footpath but they'll be screaming remake so angry about life they just screaming anyone that they see like taxi drivers are always angry about of universal there was always buses and just like they think they own the roses are being closet just quivering wrecks because they know they're spending about a thousand pounds for something steppings like their car drive anywhere in London I can't get over how much cheap the nursery fee right here nurse we see the half price is what they are in line yeah my cost is a hundred pounds cheaper here I think on that past prices are then over our price 170 or the monster condiment is only seventeen thousand ones here already maybe I watch my you say just wandering out on you and there's no one of a bonus in there also and I'm better about that just whenever I'm like I'm just going to pop in there so nothing come in either house amazing pop also have cavitation this reminds me service with my child to this journey or a smell slightly strange it's quite dirty and it's steaming up she's nice hair doesn't change it's not really nice do you think so yeah we're with it and she preached then just see a blonde woman and they like that nobody was like oh

experiences are anything about experience I only know Hannah can't do it because she's pregnant so it's probably caffeine related yeah that's court mannequins just like a super important coffee iced tea jumping Timez yeah I think it kicks off about 6:00 so we'll be there just about when it starts and then we're going to stay for an hour and hour and a half and then drive all the way back to

drive home it's really weird that like home is just 20 minutes that way it's like four hour drive now so I think it's going to be a pretty late one for us tonight hopefully this one lets us sleep in in the mornings I'm not holding out much hope from and I have had a very same warning warning it's not being intentionally snow he's been amazing this week like one of those week place has been really

today was just a can't open it okay tmobile is avoided least one you see another phone and you've knocked out other doesn't Oh everything is about to change but I see closer always coming soon spitting out of the truth is already happening it's Thursday and I'm sadly back in London I can't believe how cold it is I arrived really late last night in pouring rain freezing cold it does not feel like May a school it's actually my birthday next weekend and phimosis of like my childhood memories and even like recent years it's always been sunny like really really hot and I really feel like it's not going to be lightly hot this year which I'm gutted about and but I mean it will be nice anyway I've got a few things planned but you know I just don't know what's going on with the weather I feel so cold but tonight I am going to meet Joe and bout to go out and we're going to grab some dinner and made a veil and then go to the everyman Cyn a mother because it's really nice in a man we're going to see guardians of the galaxy because we've wanted to see it for so long but just haven't got around to seeing it so yeah I'm looking forward to that today I've just been working in my flat all day this is like my setup I've got this some laptop razor ding wait yeah and then keyboard and mouse and everything so it's much better setup than what I had before it's like much better for my posture in my back and I literally just seen it catching up on all of my emails and work today but then yes need to head off get some food and watch the film sinner crime we've come to a lovely pub called the elegan in Maybelle looking at Florian screen outside it is now Friday I've got that Friday feeling massively right now I'm so excited also you're wondering why I've suddenly got a tan from one day and can I use something called tan water no wait that was wrong I think it's good tan looks let me just get one second okay I've got it it's called tan luxe and it's called the water so this is it I literally put this on one coat last night and it's worked absolute wonders not sponsored by the way after I know that sounds like such an ad but no it's so good and you also have one to the face which is called the face and I really like this one because you literally add a couple of drops into your normal moisturizer and you wake up with glowing skin and people have actually said to me like wow you've just got a turn when you're in can for just one day like I know I know ya feel fake all fake guys and see I don't know how it's going to last or how it's going to fade you know sometimes it can go a little bit speckly so I'm hoping it doesn't do that because I'm really really happy with it right now but and the reason I decided to vlog now is because two little presents have just arrived from Matthew Williamson so I'm going to open them it's about half six now in the evening and I have barely even left my flats I went to the gym this morning have a couple of conference calls I've been editing I've been writing blog posts blog post has just gone up now from my Matthew Williamson shoot on Monday which was so much fun so go and check that out it's just name smart calm so many photos from that day and yeah now I don't know where the times gone it's half 6:00 but yeah I thought I'd open these little presents on camera so I always love presents from Matthew Williamson because of how gorgeous the paper is and I never want to ruin it oh it's that accent well yes so my friend Brad I know it would have sent this and she did actually tell me and I'm totally forgotten how cool is this I love it too lower chassis I can wear that to the gym for the three things Oh cute fan leggings they're so nice they're just plain black leggings and then at the top that beautiful print oh oh there's another thing cute opps I think really nice so this is a plain black top really seamless lovely and then a sports bra again in that lovely print another that's so gorgeous I love the back really pretty oh cool so these are little cat free plants covered in that print that's amazing oh I love it Thank You Arianna so tonight what am i doing I just realized by the way I didn't actually blog the cinema last night was so good we saw guardians of the galaxy and absolutely loved it I mean that little tree guy what's his name oh my god what's his name I can't remember my sort last night my memory is horrendous oh great are you so cute and yet absolutely loved it and then tonight we're just having a really chilled night I'm going to go over to his and cook some food what you film probably maybe go and get a glass of wine down the road at a nice wine bar and that's about it pretty chilled dinner is served I've made this vegan pesto pasta with roasted tomatoes and spinach and pine nuts get this is a big bone cut another bottle planet but I'm 17 and tonic so we came to Mexico we claimed some raspberry vet insulin and do a hit class pause fiveminute hit so hard it was a really really good night for anything down and yeah we're just basically the weights and ball kettlebells for coins and I'm wearing my new Matthew Williamson static I've got the Dubrow and me and then I just across the layer and the drop and I love it it's completely processing but I just wanted to show you out here because this is where we do yoga and it is so peaceful especially on a day like today where bright blue sky and kind of which we did yoga non self so peaceful Otto but I just love the school is so cool every time I come I try and get a really nice photo in front of this and it never works because it's always after yoga and I just look horrendous might try and get one though who comes here the Sastry gallery it will be several healthy like looking so now I'm actually in Hamburg I'm here for a really really exciting project that I am involved in and I'm going to be really annoying and say that I can't tell you what it is I mean oh that's really frustrating for you guys I wish I could tell you and but it's actually not going to be revealed until next year so I feel like even if I were to tell you it would be pointless because you'd have to wait like months and months and I'm sure you see it anyway and but yeah it's super exciting got here this evening had such a chill day I wake up went and had some breakfast at Holly's in Finland which was really really good and then just super chilled I went back to my flat had to pack came here and I was really tired before I flew and then on the flight flight was only like an hour and a half or something I I felt like I just stopped recording I just pressed the button i was like well did I start recording no I didn't and what was the saying oh yeah so I was on the flight and I was so productive where's my notepad I have a notepad I always keep in my in my bag and I'm reaching what I write this is how much you're right wait where does it start all the way to there so all of that I wrote on the plane it was just I did brainstorming new businesses that I want to start and like just extensions of my brand like everything I've come up three whole new projects that I am so excited with I didn't want that in an hour and a half amazing I'm I feel like creativity can just hit you like a train like BAM and then when that happens you just need to like grab it with both hands and make most of it and just write down everything cuz I get this like I don't know I can't explain it like this creativity just comes to me and I just like have to make nice to it when it happens because stuff like that doesn't happen very often and that you can go through stages of not feeling creative at all which you guys will know I go through and because they made a whole video of it me sitting talking about it could and timeout or taking time out remember I called it anyway I just had loads of energy and it got back here the hotel unpacked everything had so much energy big and it's by the way it's now half 11:00 at night and I'm really energetic still and I did a 20minute hit workout then I decided that I wanted to learn how to do a handstand so I've been doing handstands up against a wall and I can't do it still and it's a handstand headstand no way I could do a handstand but headstand and still trying to do it I don't know what it is don't really like being upside down but I really want to be able to do it anyway why am I so energetic half 11 this hotels really cool and it's really industrial so you come in that's all my stuff and then look at the ceiling it's basically like a warehouse and then this is the bed oh my god I was just I was amazing what is a bed made of Wow ah then literally just sink into that that looks so comfy I really want to just dive onto that I'm literally gonna dive onto this oh my god so anyway this has been my week and let me know what you think of this weekly vlog because yeah I can t remember what I did on Monday now and OH Matthew Williamson shoot yes it's been a really good week actually cut accounts for quite a lot of laughs I was actually feeling really exhausted I was meant to be away Thursday to Sunday and but then this project was brought forward because I was originally I was coming out here tomorrow and so this is brought forward to Sunday and so I would have had to cut that thing short anyway but there's just a crazy crazy week I was actually in hospital on day nine last week and it's all good nothing to worry about the thought is and that kind of just to get out of me and yeah it's been a nice week I hope you like these weekly vlogs and let me know if you prefer the daily ones instead like where I just look a whole day rather than little snippets and put it all together and but yes any nice and I hope you guys have had a good week so far whenever this video goes up and I'll see you racing bye"	3096

very productive I've written a list I picked up cool out of ten eleven twelve things so not quite halfway but getting there is just so much going on at the moment like so much going on today is it's going to be really really busy just because I really do want to get this bandage on filled up at 6 o'clock I don't want to rush it either I do want to get up in time I think I can do it I just need a solid like couple of hours to focus on it this afternoon so I finished this job this stuff one I'm probably going to have a jacket potato if I have any muscles also gonna be okay actually really need to get some food but we are going out to dinner tonight Benji's actually home this week which is great he normally works away during the week but obviously haven't been with him or seen him so I feel it his last night and that was really nice we were both just so tired like I did a really long drive yesterday the m3 was closed so I had to kind of go around almost towards Portsmouth and come back down it was an absolute nightmare it took three and a half hours to drive I didn't stop once just because I was absolutely adamant to get home so yeah I was actually shattered but we ordered an Indian and it was oh my gosh I hadn't eaten since 8 a.m. I had some chocolate buttons at about 1:00 on the plane and we were our delayed hasn't talked about and other wise I hadn't hadn't eaten and so the Indian food tasted so good I was just in my element you know when you just really want that comfort food it was good all that stuff you might have some let's go but I have something today we're going to have that for lunch today and but yeah like a couple of my fans of text me like Oh welcome home I'm like I cannot talk cause I've got so much work to do so yeah I'm actually going to start blogging

and I smash that loan I'm really really proud of this oh my gosh the GoPro footage too came up so well and if you didn't watch my visit Benidorm vlog then do go and check it out I'll link it below or at the end of this vlog I reckon I'll be finished about 4 half for maybe and then identically export it and uploading because it's a long one I'm just really praying that it goes up to six make a thumbnail write the description just have a shower I don't know if you can see I have slight turn marks a slight bill like I've been on hot bin ahora obviously been away and I'll because they've been on holiday but anyway I'm just going to find something to wear for tonight the Sun has come out is boiling outside I'm so godlike Congrats ray but the vlog is uploading and it's looking likely it's

oh it's good night tonight oh my gosh love a quiz night okay I've been in 20 line timing and salinity good morning happy Tuesday I'm a little bit hungover today I can't have what happened that last night that restaurant was so nice and was so lovely still around Joe's birthday and but it was so hot in there I think all of us were like sweating and that would the mix of a lot of wine and the food didn't come out like nine o'clock and it was just what he thought as a cheese and wine cheese and wine it was like cheese and bread board and it was super nice but like I don't know I'm not a massive cheese person and so I don't I think too much too much alcohol not enough food really really hot made me really like a weird drunk like I felt really sleepy and just like really dazed and then when we came out here I went to bed I couldn't sleep for ages I was up that we were both off about three o'clock and we checked our phones and we saw the news about the attack in Manchester which was awful and that made us wide awake because we were just up thinking about how how tragic that any attack is tragic but especially when there's children a concert just awful absolutely awful and it'll probably be a week behind when this videos up thoughts and prayers get to everybody who is in Manchester was affected absolutely awful so so yeah is 20 past seven so my tasks for today I was going to go meet my friend Georgie for lunch but we've rearranged in those days now quite free which is great because I've got to do some washing unpacking tidying I've got to write my Benetton blog posts I've got to write and so I'm going to do one I'll make the activities in January about Benidorm and then I'm going to do one about some of the food places we ate at because I've got some really nice pictures I think that's why I'm envisioning in my head but yeah I'm going to crack all that it's probably going to take me a few days to write the posts like by the time you do the pictures edit them import them write you know blood glass and hungover unintentionally hungover brilliant so yeah I'm back from Aldi and I just had to reschedule and double check over all my clients tweets and things because I want anything that I've prescheduled to be sensitive towards today's event and enlighteners event so yeah it's some really hype I just walk around the supermarket feeling just like lost like a magical jewel child event food shopping Thank You Khaled low at the moment oh okay I'm at my desk now I have a coffee and I have about 100 comments to apply to I think maybe more can I write some breakfast Commission tidying and I'm going to film a video today because um my hair is clean and nice it'll put some makeup on and them I'm going to be my may favorites I could do April favorite I

done today then it's done it's 20 past five and I'm going to be honest I have struggled to concentrate today it will already be done by now I personally hope to get some of the end of the week but I just doing the picture so I'm breaking it down so obviously this is the bike tour this is the old town I really like this one that Jordan took with me this is jet skiing so I'm just doing that one and now I'm snorkeling so this is actually taken me hours I know it doesn't look like it does take me so long this is my BOB by the way I want to go actually until it looks like currently I did talk about this briefly in my last week we've all but I've revamped it and I've also added shot my wardrobe and like all the things I get asked about the most and then the posts read and look like this and then you can click into them to expand them I've had a couple of people give me some feedback like 90 set of people really liked it but some will send at the side was too messy so I focused on because I had like popular post on the side as well so I change it and I put like my Facebook page here the Batwa gym I got like a really simple full way and it's a story love thing and story Instagram thing and I still have space down the side as you can see so a little bit of work in progress and I'm not too sure if this looks a bit too cluttered I might change this and I might make these pictures bigger but that's the beauty of having a blog is that I can adjust and adapt accordingly a lot really follow my hair like this but just printed it off my face it's at like as it's got to help us five and Benji's on its way over and making of carbon oxygen tonight and we're just going to have a night in so I'm gonna end the vlog here for today and I will see you tomorrow I just tied it up so everything's nice and clean then wash up last night I've done this morning and it is a squawk so I need to stop we're gonna make a cup of tea as well and today I'm working on my free lunch stuff for a large portion of the day and I'm going to carry on with my fellow dorm dog pose and it gets the post off base much it really nothing exciting discharged about Church in this so I'm going to do that come back to you later okay it's lunchtime and I finished my freelance stuff I had a bit uh nightmare actually because facebook business pages were bound so I can actually do half my work which is a bit annoying I'm not very hungry for lunch yet so I'm basically looking out by my window and it's super sunny and I don't have a garden or anything but I still need shoot loads of work so I'm going to go to the gym I'm not actually going to do a workout I'm just going to sit in the outside area use their WiFi and catch a little bit of sunshine there to get my lunch there and carry on working because I've got this Benidorm stuff done I really want to get one of the post up today and I also need to edit a video here something up hide in the pool to my email I'm still my comment and I've been inside the last four hours my niche my Benidorm for both one or three I've edited my equal flash may favorite skin than the description and thumbnail and I'm not letting it right at my audio my phone because it was rated up in love and now I'm going to stop the second book oh it's hi Benj is working in chance for today but he's coming back training such as he's coming home but he'll be heading back up off sick and the good sense it is quarter to eight I don't really know where the times gone to be honest but I was at the gym working away it got for like quarter past 6: I drove to Lidl to get some dinner for Ben's night tonight we were going to make stuffed putters and then he called me and he was like I've been sick I've got heat stroke and he's been working outside I think he's been working in a really hot room and and he wasn't very well so I have a huge phobia of sick and I'm I ended up driving back home mother drive home I spoke to Charlotte also known as Little Miss chicas and Charlotte a rough shot who I'm going toward Disney World with in September and so we she went away on her solo trip and then I went and it's all fun actually had a proper catch up with her we were on the phone for an hour and minutes until I was like I'm very hungry I haven't eaten actually didn't have lunch today I just had a couple of snacks and I had a smoothie so not exactly the best I need some food so I'm going to fix and famine in got since I'm interesting for me to rest up you know you can fall I've got some mash and I'm just going to stick some veg with it pretty boring really my postal voting packs have come through it some kind of complicated I don't there's a lot of like numbers and my name and my dress favourites I'm not going to show you it however I'm basically going to be on holiday when it's the election day so I obviously registered to vote and I requested postal vote it was actually I have to do it on my mother's house as I had to scan over this like registration form to do a postal vote actually watch my month just for my behalf which I think she can now but I am just going for postal vote anyway there's instructions on what to do so basically sit and figure out there's six steps I've done it um yeah that took a lot longer than I thought it was going to it's basically against all the council and I have to follow all these instructions properly so there's an envelope inside here and then on my details and I've signed it and dated it and stuff and yeah that was the step by step it wasn't too complex that you just I can imagine somebody's maybe getting that wrong but I think I've done a fine but yeah I've now officially done my vote two weeks before the actual date obviously I'm not here to tell you who I voted for or my political opinion on anything because I'm not comfortable discussing it and although I like to use my voice I just want to raise awareness for voting and that it's important to vote and if you're registered and do make sure you take the time on the day of the 8th of June which was the 8th to go down and vote for the party that you believe in the most and so yeah I'm done I'm going to post that off later everybody happy Thursday I am outside at nando with Fraser phrasal ultimate come with me fenders must be come with me tonight to see practic a bein but he's not very well so second bus some

thing involvement if you heard like this it's also like warmest darkest secrets of things and our focus for supplying to talk to more about it on something but absolutely really scary with like dive

Christmas being in the year they released Winnie the Pooh collection I didn't get anything from the winning the Pooh collection because nothing really stood out to me but then when I got the email through dimensions that was one of my favourite films and little girl and I really like what they've done to me the collection just feels a bit more girly it's got more of their like cap kits and classic rose petals all over it which you'll see in a sec and I just fell in love with it and then I got an email from the lovely people at cap kits and who I've known for ages because I met them way back in 2015 when they redesigned some of the beach shops and in Bournemouth so I met the pr girls then and yeah they said oh we've got a parcel with your name on it come and confirm your address and I was like that yeah we said they said we've got a Disney cast with your name on it can we confirm your address Mel's like huh and it came the next day which was yesterday but my brother was meant to bring it for dinner dinner last night and he didn't he forgot so nonetheless I am here to show you what I got so it is absolutely stunning and this is actually the first time I'm going through it I've had a little like sneaky peek because I was too excited but I just wanted to give you my first impression so the first thing on the top is the phone case it's a rubber phone case black it says Disney X cap Kitson and it's got one of the puppies peeking over the top which I absolutely love now I love you note I have an eye ring on my phone which I really likes I think I'm just going to put this on for a bit of fun and they were going to go on holiday I just really liked it they only do for an iPhone 7 so I'm pretty pleased that I'm going to set my phone I am a sucker for stationery I love nice stationery and this is a really beautiful notebook that's got all the puppies on and rose petals all over it this is going to be my new work and blog book because it's actually a really decent size it's a really nice like the hard quality on the front and then got sliced thick lined paper inside so I absolutely adore that don't ask me how much these things are I have no idea I'll link them below and then you can see if there's anything left by the time this goes up I also have a pencil case which is so perfect if I don't own a pencil case and actually when I go away or go to a meeting and I really do need just a little something to carry some pens and a pencil and stuff in so this is gorgeous because it matches and it actually says cap kits and on the label really really really cute perfect in the same print there's a little like wash bag makeup bag whatever you want to use it for I actually have a little black bag I use from all my period essentials and all my tournaments and it broke I've had it for years and years and years and it's recently broke as its broke and this is actually going to be a plasticlike size for me to carry my bits and bobs round in and set up I'm basically going to use it for real ah this is an apron oh my god I don't own an apron not I do a lot of cooking or baking art hello isn't this amazing I don't want to get it all out really because I'm going to photograph it but it's basically it's Naquin and it's in the same print and it's adorable oh my god I love it ah open it I got a new husband it oh my gosh my oven that's horrible it from Ikea oh my gosh it's a double one as well this is so nice it's going to look so cute in my kitchen it's got a lamb hook as well because I hang my things in my kitchen so I love it how pretty is that especially while I live on my own my flat super girly that is perfect a little wash bag this is so so damn cute it's basically spotty black and white and it's like clear I can imagine this cleans very easily and washes really well so I really do like this they do a bigger version as well and I'm tempted if they still have any left to get the bigger version to I have one of each but it's such a nice quality I absolutely love it their collection is so gorgeous and then I'm saving the best to last because this is my always a pen pen oh my god that's adorable oh my gosh how adorable the 10 matches I can put that many pens case of mini notebook I said in the best to last this one is by far my favorite of all of it I think maybe the same case as well or two no but this is from the like townhouse range I think so you like the rose print which is what majority value is and then you've got this really gorgeous like townhouse puppy range this is an overnight bag but I've noticed it's got little poppers on so I think this goes inside the bag but you basically the bag comes like this which is just so good for traveling and I'm going to take this with my hand luggage bag when I go away next week so I don't have to describe it but the inside is become wash it easily and it's pretty big this is going to be so perfect for traveling and I'm presuming the pressure inside yes it does I am smitten and actually submission another I love it so much all right so gorgeous just a disclaimer this isn't sponsored I was just very kindly sent me things I didn't have to talk about them cap cuts and just very generous because they know my love for Disney thank you very very very much cap Kitson for being super generous and I love everything very much it's all going to get lots of good use and good lies one of the best email packages I've had an ages I'm so fussy I just don't know what to say it blows my mind that Bratton send stuff to people like me and I will be a very good brand

now so I'm going to put that all away and have done like that's from Benidorm so I'm going to repack it and rely on it ready for next week and then a few bits and bobs lying around and the fins and stuff so we're going to go to the beach hunt today tonight because my quality money tomorrow but the weather's awful is like chalky or rain so I think we're just going to have really chilled Sunday a home and is next door watching the formula 1 and I've got some work to do so I've got edit this vlog handle any editing this week for this videos I've got to do that that in a few hours I've got to finish up some blog posts I've been working on for Benidorm I want to kind of get that wrapped up in the next week because then Henry stuff will star in all honesty I didn't really know how to talk about this but since the Manchester attacks on Monday I've been thinking a lot about it over the last week I know it's been a week since you guys watched watching this video but the more I think about it the more sad it makes me feel and I was obviously out with my friends last night and we had a really nice night actually we were just we have I was driving so I had and nightclub drinks but we all had like some drinks outside in the Sun a place would be stable and we went to rib originally but so packed in that we moved to the stable and we just set out aside and it was nice and we didn't go home to like half 11 and so we spent hours and hours and hours chatting and one of the topics of the soup was Monday's attacks and we're talking about how well just how obviously devastating is and how that individual targeted those children a concert and it breaks my heart I don't really know the right words to say in all honesty other than I am thinking of anyone who's been affected by Monday's attack my thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who is suffering or his friends or family or was there because I can't imagine how scary that would have been on that night and I've read lots of things on social media about how you know it's realized people and I can't I can't imagine what that must feel like and be like you had a few subscribers and girls particularly reach out to me I've had a few messages on Instagram from girls saying that they were there or they were affected by the attacks and they've watched my videos this week and that's helped them but regardless if they're watching my videos are not I am replying and speaking to people on social media and Twitter and stuff and I just don't have the right words in all I'm scared it has the best words to define or guidance or anything other than that my thinking of all of you so so actually the time is logoff here today just so I can edit and chill and Curly arson because my boyfriend today this week I'm going to try and do a packing video for Tenerife so there'll be one more week you saw on Monday while I'm away it will be a short one a Monday to Friday weekly vlog for you and I was trying to packing video

cardigan for the holiday I had one on my last trip in Benidorm and it's got a bit like offwhite now so this is a ziploc Jackie obviously but I want to get a cardigan I think that's like the absolute staple for any trip for me because it just goes with every outfit so these get a new one and I don't want to spend a lot so as that I also need to get some dinner for myself tonight the suspense is working late and I do with more milk and I don't really want to get too much because I'm obviously going on holiday so just give me a few essentials a bit and do a little meat and then I start like at

wanted plain white color B so that is going to go on homey and then I also picked up a new pair of gym leggings I really wanted a pair of gray gym bottom so a poor medium by joonas they're going to be

black but I'm going to mix it up and then the other day one bench and I went to the beach we took some food out we took our dinner down and I didn't have a core bag so I've been on the hunt for one this was seven pounds and its really cute because it's got like bunnies and like little garden basket and plant pots on it got to dip at the front and then it's literally just your Bob Turner cool bag but I like the fact it's got fairly decent handles as well so I can carry it on my shoulder so that's going to go up with my shopping bags if it's more deodorant it's my favourite mitchum unscented it was cheap and fifty announcer picked up saving mr. banks because it's not on it's not on Disney life and I couldn't see it on Netflix and it's a film I wanted to keep anyway so it was only three

let's kind of focus that agree there we go it's a pro and we didn't get to pick the color so it's got this kind of like check early color which don't particularly like that I wanted a red and black one burr that's fine it basically bounces on water it's quite a like nifty little thing really okay and it was like seven pounds I think hmm I just picked up these little flower hair clips because I

four bags of my favorite which in accordance chokolate chips coconut things I picked up a new little purse even though I absolutely adore my little Jack wheels Carl told one I keep losing it and I want to find a bit bigger I can put my euros in on holiday so I'm using this little white thing it was four pounds and then I got some anklets I'm actually wearing the bottom one but look how pretty these are they were two pounds I love anklets and I was wearing one and lost it so I've got a little blue and gold BB one on at the moment and there's some stairs and then I picked up there like night dress I guess it's going to be instead of pajamas and so pretty at hand percent cotton it's just a dress and I prefer wearing these in bed on holiday and just because they're nice and light and cool and lovely so I've got a new one and then I went to Zara Russ this is bizarre a dress I'm going to wear on Saturday for the party this was quite ignored management it was 40 pounds I just didn't envision spending that money on a dress today but it looks so nice on me and so it is just a white lace dress but what's really nice is it's got um I scooped back so that that goes off at the top and is it open back for you wear it with no bra and honestly it looked so pretty on I couldn't help myself you know when you try something on and you just feel really pretty in it kind of like that and

going to pick me up later because I'm going to stay here again tonight and so that my car is still at mine and everything is here so I'll show you these my little earrings I picked up so I basically had pretty much identical ones and they were so old and the backs were those right backs anymore and they were falling out and when my mom did my hair the other day as she brushed my head it fell out and I was like I can't go away without just something in them and I just wanted something planes I went to H Samuel I asked on Twitter no to be recommended like Claire's and accessorized by I needed them to be either sterling or white gold and I told the lady that most earrings I wear do you make me because I have very sensitive skin and a lot of my jewelry is silver she said to go for white gold so we went for white gold and then I got to pick which side I'm on talented and these ended up being about thirty pounds so they were little pricey well I don't know in comparison to some of the like sterling someone's if you can just wear normal silver then you can get cheap earrings that we thought this size kind of suited me best so I love them so yeah they need to my life that I can like accidentally hit them now they don't fall off which is great that was really boring I'm going to go home currently doing some pining I've painted my nails red I wasn't sure I we're going to have pink

"no_WEEKLY VLOG #105  DECLUTTERING & RINGOS"	"good morning and welcome back to another weekly vlog it feels really nice to be home I came back from Tenerife last night and it's currently 5:30 in the morning and Benji's just gone to work he's working away today and somewhere up north four and a half hours away so he's up and on and I'm kind of awake when I go back to sleep because I start like at 8:00 and I set my long for 7 which gives me an hour to like shower and have breakfast and get ready for the day and but it's yeah I have five I'm I'm awake waking up slowly so I am probably just going to get up and start the day and because I have a lot to do today obviously I've been away I'm a freelance social media manager so I work for a company and I have clients where I manage their social medias basically so I'm going to be doing that today catching up over the last week and scheduling some stuff for today and tomorrow then the rest of the week is looking pretty hmm not quiet I guess just getting back into routine it's my best friend Megan's birthday this week so I mean still out her present actually have her a gift and I have bought her tickets to a gig that she wants to go to but I'd like to get a few little bits so I'm gonna get our cards any sort of her present this week and it's my mum's birthday in two weeks time so I'd like to get her stuff sorted as well and then it's my friend George's birthday after that so lots of birthdays at the moment I unpacked last night I've got two loads of washing and organizing from the holiday and I did a little mini food shot last night so I got milk I've got get bread I've got eggs anything up some bread I've just got the shower as you can see it's actually five o'clock and I was like I need to stop and have a break and get in the shower because I felt so grim so carry on doing some work I had so much to do today so so much and I think I'm trying to juggle with too many things today but it is Monday and it dog days I had to stop and sort the vlog out and get that up and then I have got ten clients and I've done six oh I four more to go and the last one is pretty easy but the other three are quite complex so I'll probably need a couple more hours like two or three hours at least so this window open by my bedroom nail is so nice and bright and airy I love it the bend of the way tonight and tomorrow night he's back Wednesday night about a couple of days to myself which I really really really miss him but at the same time quite looking forward to just a bit of me time and I really would like to have a nice hot bath at some point relax or goes to gym but I've gotta get this work done first and then I can do those things and trying to balance life a just how it goes but yeah I'm going to stick on some like fresh comfy pajamas now and can't see knickers and geureon I've got some vlogs playing in the background I had 27 videos on my watch later so just having those on in the background it's not too bad so when I come another cup of tea back on 25:11 I finished work like 9 o'clock and I'm so tired and went to lie down in bed and I've literally spent two hours messaging mimei watching YouTube which in point it's a two videos now finally going to bed I'm gonna brush my teeth morning happy Tuesday I'm just making myself some breakfast I've got fruit fiber cereal a banana and yogurt and I run out of almond milk and bread so I'm gonna make eggs and scrambled eggs and scrambled egg Wow I was going to be discovered egg and avocados on toast I don't have any spread so I need to go and pull up the shorts if I have a nasal parcel coming so I need to wait for that first I'm going to film a video but it's going to be one for that I'm doing as a like a fan apps for attraction cigarette who I work sit on the Sun Park ticket so I'm going to the top 10 tips videos to them and so I've written that allow me lift myself I had a nice little lie in this morning so I went to bed about midnight it was kind of late in the end and my launch is looking that bad it's just a little bit messy worth what I'm packing to do and so it's just going to be a day of errands filming editing the video close to the brand and then popping out the shots getting some bread and milk and watching love Island but benjin I've got a lot to catch up on so on Episode four or five and there's at least ten or twelve so we're quite behind so once I'm caught up then I can like start commentating on it but so far I'm loving it and it's really funny because it reminds me so much of when I first moved into this flat I loved loved Islands help battle loneliness I was watching it every night of talking to you guys on Twitter about it and yeah it was really funny to have it back on again like commonly within a year so I also want to show you this I just did learn I've got many here very apt cuz I'm taking a picture with her but I ordered these books so if your insert Disney or Walt Disney while you're planning a trip you're going on a trip then you might not know that Disney offer free planning tools so I'll link it below if you're interested but you just order a book and it took about a week or two to come and this big book here has got everything you kind of need so that tells you all about each Park oh my gosh look how amazing it looks and then it's got all the hotels in it so let's find our one so this is where we're staying cabin Beach Resort as it tells you like everything about the hotels I love this kind of thing for you on a holiday and all that fun stuff but the best bit is this little one which is actually called the little big book of magic and what I love about this first of all it has stickers in the back I don't know if this is like pleasing to anybody else I love the stickers it says we're going to walk this new world which is awesome and it's got like a nice little rough itinerary in case you don't want to make your own it's all the information needed about the dining plans but the best bit is it's actually got maps in it so if I show you for example actually Epcot's a good example at court it has all these different pavilions from around the world and I don't obviously have never been so I don't know I have been to what Disney World but as a kid so I don't remember at all but and I'm treating as a firsttimer because I don't remember it but I don't obviously know where all the pavilions are so it's really cool for me to like get two groups of it because obviously this is like second nature to Charlotte but I want to have a rough idea of where I'm going and what we're doing so then it tells you like which rides four little ones to the family big thrills and it's really really really helpful so if you're interested it's absolutely free not being paid although I wish it was Disney if you want to sponsor me ever then please do get in touch but ya know I'm a massive advocate for planning books and guides and things are helpful and tips and advice and stuff so that is that I'm going to find a home for that I've just booked my friend Georgie's birthday in with her so we're doing do you know if you watched my channel flog you know there's a lot of things on the water whose inflatable things we have one of those new forests we're doing that for her birthday in a couple of weeks and that weekend's can be so good actually because that whole week it's my mom's birthday and I've got a surprise day planned for her she actually watched the vlog of German I literally can't talk today she actually watches these vlogs I can't tell you what I was yet but on the Thursday we're doing like fun the Friday is the water park for Georgie's birthday Saturday I'm going to thought part of the day with Amy and Bianca Saturday night we're going out for Georgie's birthday and it's just something on the Sunday either way it's going to be mega jampacked that week I've actually been invited to go to Malaga the day that week as well the brand but it's quite a long way to go just of the day so I'm going to find out today if we can get a flight from Bournemouth but they have a slide out from Bournemouth but I don't think they have one coming back so logistical elearning is going to work but how fun would that been go to Malaga for the day just for the day this shoots a little campaign but I've locked my netting I really hate these nets like they're very ugly but caught them in the window or my best thoughts out but they do give me a little bit of privacy so okay I'm going to shut up now you look how much nicer my desk looks when it's not all cluttered I've just taken all the bit fat in the corner and now I have known where to like fit all these things like look at all the stuff I took off the desk so I'm going to keep it like that then I think I need to go to Ikea and get some drawers because I didn't have anywhere to put all my paperwork and stuff so I need to make that happen at some point my manager Paul is going to give me a call any minute now and once I'm done that I've got my cap Kitson notebook I am loving this and the pen to take notes Oh who's calling me okay middle Yeats time we won the phone for 45 minutes I have written down to April pages of the notes and so I've got three more emails coming in I'm slow busy today I'm potentially going up to London a couple of times in the next couple of weeks and I've got eight six minutes now left remaining of my upload for this sponsored video the once that's up I'm going to send that over and then I'm going to pop into town get some foodie bits I might pop to Primark which is bit naughty I might pop in there see what we've got and what else my doing but pretty much my day I'm having feeling really good today like feeling really positive I had loads of lovely comment on the Tenerife vlog so thank you so much if you watch that it had almost 8,000 views really love this bag the Croatia but I just don't need another bag but pounds at this time this is nice and old our baby I really like these bikini bags these amazing that you're like wet percent these are cute I like these they're nice why are these back from a very exciting shopping trip Fox into Primark and I just wanted a couple more tops I can throw on on the boat in Croatia so I plan on wearing tshirts and shorts a lot as watching about my blog actually watch the whole thing from Greece last year and I remember just loving throwing on tshirt shorts so I picked up this one which I love actually got them in a sixteen I took the 14 in which fitted fine I wanted them a little bit baggy in fact I think she even got again but they were only two pounds fifty and this one has an American flag on it it says Los Angeles the city of California I really like this one for two pounds fifty I wear that around the house and I saw this and I thought this would be cute with a pair of white shorts I've got a pair and they have actually got the American flag on the pockets on the bum and I just thought this would be really nice of it it's a black though it's got this nice neon electric again California logo thing on it I like that a lot so they were each I got the chip purse there was only five left on the counter and everyone was getting not to them and I was like I don't need this in my life but I wanted so I actually might give it away on Twitter because I know so many people want this it was only four pounds and it is cute it is really nice in person I think it's not like I wouldn't use it for like coins but it would be quite cute to store little bits in it I don't know having decided this I'm going to keep it myself yet but I saw it and I was like well if I don't keep it then I'll give it away but found shit I switched my case again by the way I've got the

weeks I think that might be next Friday actually and the airport we've got an actual pool in its backyard which is quite cool so we're doing that tomorrow afternoon and then we're going out from Evans birthday so I'm really not quite in the mood yet but I think if I try and some outfits today and I do my hair makeup I sell probably more mood but yeah this is my wardrobe in here and I want this clear really I mean I've got books and stuff of storage and but I want to clear that out so I want to tackle that today I might move the bed over to the edge but I do quite like being round it and I want to sort this out don't know what's going on here I could so utilize that space and much better and maybe put some of those boxes from down there because you can obviously stack them put them in there because it's really high the ceiling was like huge up there Oh wrapping paper I don't realize I had some wrapping paper pot that I want to move all those bags back to where they originally were which is along there and obviously look at all these products like it's so messy and I've got like random books and Diaries and things like I want to get rid of that this is all my makeup like a lot of people ask to makeup collection like this literally all I have really and so I've gone through this fairly recently so I know this isn't too bad they don't have to go to the makeup I never actually use half of it to be honest but that needs sorting out and yeah I'm just feeling a little cluttered like I've got little bags on the back here too bad I think I'm going to start by doing this section and I will keep you updated but yeah I just have so many things everywhere and I don't like it there's all these wires as well all the time I have bloody wires coming out my ears and that's not even unpacked from holiday I'm just going to shove that all of them in it that white box there I was looking for all through the winter it's my scarf and hats and gloves so I finally found it and I put it there now so I can see it all my tall boots are here and then I've got flipflops down trainers and heeled boots and their normal high heels on the bottom and then under here I need to sort these bags out I have so many handbags it's a bit silly well this is all of them and then the little one pen the door and what is that I've got a bag and that also got a bedsheet in there or God knows I do need to sort through these house it's called embedding so like that's bedding that's bedding so I can really do with a towel pile and a bedding pipe I'm making progress I have organized my towels these are overnight bags so they're collect big weekend away bags this has got all like birthday bags paper and my iron and then I've got all my bedding which I didn't realize how much betting I have but I've got like three or four sets in there handbags rucksacks and my long JumpStart bags and then I also hung my canvas bags I've just kind of hooked them over there for a second when I say work but just on the ioan I just want them to sit so I can grab them when I need them so I've got like a youtube one I've got a blogging one in a lush bag they're quite good for like shopping good shopping I might actually put my food shopping bags in here as well oh so hot they help take my jumper off and this is the state of my room now that is all for charity full of this that is a whole bag of makeup skincare beauty stuff I've been hoarding that I don't want anymore there's also a notebook and a ninety on the top there but the rest of its product I'm going to do first tips to my mum my grandma and my mum's staff they're all girls so I'm going to ask them say what they want anything from there I've got a spare tripod which I think my brothers and then I've got like all these old shoes I just don't really wear dolly shoes anymore I don't really think these suits me either I mean they'll right there just Primark so I'm going to get rid of things I never wear then we've got a ton of rocks accent canvas bags and bits I don't needle you so they're going to go to charity shop that's the beauty stuff I am keeping so I have a nice big hole here I just got to do this section now so we're getting there bed still looks like this which is frustrating and this is all the mess so some of its from my mum's house charity bin and the white one and that one are recycling and I'm going to recycle these hangers as well like I don't need a whole box in my wardrobe or hangers so I'm just going to get rid of them and that is all period stuff they like sanitary towels and things I'm going to try and take to a women's shelter I've moved the side table from that side to this side so I have more space to like move around here but it means that Benji can still get in and out the bed when he goes to work in the morning when he says so this works a lot better I've almost finished all this as well so it's looking really nice and it's definitely coming together I changed all my hangers to all velvet ones I've been collecting these over a long period of time I get them in home bargains and they're about I think it's about far pound for seven or eight or something but I have a couple left and that's close I need to hang up this is all clean I need to hang up from holiday and I have my wash bag in here now and I used to have that in that cupboard it was really awkward to get it in and out I don't know why I didn't think about putting it there but I'm going there now my gym bag so I can just grab it and go I've got makeup bags down there that's something questions up there but I still need to sort out a couple of these bits here like I need to fold these clothes but this is all much better like that was completely full up this morning so this is all beauty stuff I'm keeping

Monty's burgers in Bournemouth so the best in mind I need to get myself ready and I'm going to London tomorrow I'm going to be meeting simple skin care who are hosting an event at kind of like a gym with an outside pool so I hope the weather perks up so don't know if we're going to be outside or not but I don't know what to wear yet I don't know what's a safe bet to be honest but I need to obviously get ready for London perhaps things I mean I actually washed my hair yesterday as you saw but like this humidity and not drawing my hair it's just gone on freely and naughty so I'm gonna give it the brush give it a nice deep condition and then yeah basically get myself ready I've been signing up a little bit so I've been washing up and the lounge is coming together now my bedroom is still an absolute bomb sites that really do need to work on that at some point I've taped my nails white as well I'm just kind of trying them to see if I want them white for my holiday I do actually have the some elegant touch nails as well so I might take them with me anyway and stick those on when my nails cut shit I ordered something from ASOS arrives today so first of all I got new pair of Havana's the needs of my favorite flipflops in the whole world I call them Havana's but they are actually heavy honors I think that's actually how you say it have the Yanis I know I've always called them Havana's but anyway so I love these I got them for my 25th birthday so it happened two years and they served me so well I love them a lot and they're pretty much all I live in and I kind of wanted a second pair and I went on a self and I was just browsing that's all they had Disney one so I already had to get these and I'll link them below if you're interested because I haven't seen anyone talking about them yet or anything and I just think they're gorgeous so yeah they came and then then I also ordered this dress from boohoo it's so cute what when Isis but it's from boohoo I really like the detailing on it I think it's so pretty for holiday it's quite a thin material but it sucks me in at the waist here which is my favorite part and it's even got a little pockets which is great of an evening and just tucking my phone in my pocket but yeah I really like it really suits me and I think this is in the sales like pounds or something I will link that below if you're interested but I think I'm out of bath bombs from being honest let me have a look yeah I'm at bath one so do they're hot and cold all excited for a bar and I'm going to use a little bit of body short almond honey almond milk and honey and zoella taupe opera I'm going to do some of those I meant out as talking or with rain decided to coming at my eyebrows on so I meet Megan for dinner I just build them and they have took me so long to do in like this head up with them again get a wax in tinted with my favorite girl in we're going to fit cosmetics them counter moment for these PowerPoint I've come for the monster burger which looks insane I think there's an onion ring in there I was it a full monty I can't take my onion rings out I don't think I'm going to be able to like say by holding my mouth that looks good and we have to be Jewish Messiah these are my eyebrows I think they look really nice she's done a really good job on them I'm obviously they're quite dark when they're first done but once I've showered and the tips portion off a little bit them they will blend back into my face however I'm sorry I'm starting out at breakfast I just like practically power walk through the rain and Benny was trying to say is the girl at benefit in Bournemouth infinity Hamer's she's super nice and she does such a good job because I've been going to that same brow bar for years now and there used to be a really great girl but she went on the time to leave and never came back and then since then no one's really been as good but infinity is amazing high or under if you're embalmer also by the way benefit browse you can book an appointment on their website which i find a lot easier i can see what times are available and then get an email confirmation to say when your appointment is I just really like the whole service and they also have a new app called brow Wow not sponsored I wish it was dispensable sponsoring the nuts cool but they have a new app and they scan it all electronically now and you can if used to get the loyalty cards with Debenhams and benefit they now do that online so my next one I guess pretense which is great and worth takes the think tint is like tennis a wax and a brown wax and pin is 20 pounds so in my expenses well I don't get it done that often and it gives me such a confidence boost especially when I'm going on holiday I'm not going in makeup I'm going to a lot of photos but what my brows to look like that you dad cut ginger pairwise reddish very light auburn hair my hairs all but it's sometimes more brown and it's more red but it means my eyebrows sometimes look like they're hardly there I hate that so anyway enough for eyebrows just finished dinner with Megan it was soup at 9:00 about five seven back to ours and all my goodness it was so nice the barber was delicious I'm now not going to be hard for a couple weeks I'll be going away it's nice have a catchup it's tracking it was rain I'm wearing jeans and they're like stuck to my leg feels like winter all of a sudden a bit weird kind of like already missing for sunshine but anyway so I'm off to get a bunch of house this is his bedroom and I have hung up two outfits to wear tomorrow hold on oh my that's my drawer of my things I don't know which dress to go for or you can Li see the one on the left a bit more somewhere a bit more mean this one's a bit more smart bit bit better for a Bloggie event this morning I think your chances are that well yeah because in a brush with my time if I had about three minutes inside I do manage to get myself a drink from a specialist I won't prove to other state of the day suppose England to having an event and I've got any complication added within a like try out for me they've got new range the warmth of you grain oh you're beautiful balls through other people think I will find out more later but yeah so they they didn't budge enough today I get in at about ten o'clock spoon to behave a moment and then I'm going to swing away the Brixton and then we're going to metal modern samples of my work it look at yeah I get to the letter club with a pool of that I think that's been you know all very nearly closings always so yeah learn a dress from apricot my music note despondent by eight o'clock so I like a lot my draft status of a little carbon on sleep and then another decade a market bastard a good half hour only was taking the cell and I've got their legs we looked at some of the energy coming sighs I hope you haven't approached a paper import of the day and then they even have brand in fact me today this is the venue gun side you you you in not every time behind the possible and you've got like little pouches with that for me I guess it's pretty busy around him I don't really have quite noisy some research and hear me complain but I just can't me event it was it was pretty quick it was really good fun I was given my turn for my men timeslot and I'm starting and ended it was really the sort of event that like you hang around for and so then it was exciting to be a bit longer so it was really lovely and I'm exciting such as the new products are talking about the one at home but I do not do myself now so taken two hours from up here and I'm going in the event so minute some time ago like it's wait to journey that I'm going to do something none of my pals are free I might be Sapporo pry marks and really like that one it's really big and it's got a lot of salt so I might just go and have a little Mooji I don't really need anything necessarily but yeah I might go and have a little like mood so I'm not sure so I get myself a brick since on the road and something called robot school to do and then we'll see much more men so basicly maybe that was my day but I feel like I don't go and do a little something then it specifically with you early p.m. I claim it's half and there's a train at 5 4 3 and then that all the past to train so anyway join me on a little trip Primark phone because you might have to come off of anything I did eat had a drink small insect inopportune so I haven't lost any weight calm winds not feeling very sexy and just like that I'm back and warmer it was a quick chain as an hour 45 minutes which I like a lot because I can prolong it also loves busy involve transition today I love it so much and folks now it's great once I think should be event I went off the street and I walked to prime up Tottenham Court Road I stopped as sports director picked up Al's running short through their night I'm wearing them now to stop my chub rub my chafing and I quickly realized that I'm getting bigger and bigger I'm putting on way I'm fully aware of it I think because I'm really happy at the moment and I'm in a new relationship and we do eat out a lot on we are bit naughty sometimes and I haven't been exercising as much therefore have some weight and it's not really a surprise my mum's like you know this has having support for you you know what you need to do I do know what I need to do but then oh it's Primark and the total court bro products is super nice there was so much choice I took like eight things in the change around couple of swimming questions I thought maybe a little bit more confidently swimming costume at the weekend and honestly I ended up crying in the changing room looking at myself I even tried on a really nice light pink denim jacket and pink spray jacket that's got some really nice ones at the moment but neither of them that right they didn't fit my body shape right basically I'm the biggest and heaviest I've been in a really long time and I know I need to do something about it because crying about it doesn't help I think I might start a food diary and writing down what anything and we're just getting back in the gym yeah so I'm going to make better food choices I'm going to stop snacking on naughty things I'm gonna get back in the gym precious breath and see this how unfit I am I think the pressure is slightly on because I'm going away and I'm going to be in a bikini and I really want to get some photos of me and my holiday and I'm just not looking and feeling my best and I know I'm not alone I know loads of girls and guys feel like this but it's just accepting it like not the end of the world that I Conway and I know a lot of people in the comments would be like oh you can't tell you still look sad and that is such a nice confidence boost and the last time I mentioned that I'd put a little bit away as so many people were super nice about it I'm not too upset about it now I think I had a little meltdown in the pronoun ginger room yeah it's just coming to terms of accepting that I've put on the way I need to shift it again anyway I going to go pick up Benji now he's staying at my house tonight and there's sunshine perfect I'm going to try and get a blob photo of my simple think after and and that hopefully will be up is the art webinar might be working on it one of them pray over anyway we have come down to the beach so I can take some pictures of the products that got given today and so we can go for a little power walk again we can't do it the other day that way so we're going to bit of exercise in two and one so I'm walking down to the end of Faust compare it's quite good location here and Lincoln is doing some down on the sand down there and I look so good so this is happening right now I'm shooting a little picture here at the beach and I like it because this is a hydrating booster range which I can actually show you while I'm here to do this so these are the three new product and then if you can actually hear me as a sea but this is the micelle a gel wash the hydrating booster which you can use the primer mixed in with your foundation and is amazing actually I tried it earlier and this is a cleansing water as well so I'm really looking forward to using my makeup take that same eye makeup off of that wash my face with that and then using some of this so this is meant to be amazing for dehydrated and dry skin which is definitely me so these are coming nationwide to stores in September but I still so in boots today so they are making their way into stores now if your interest yeah I'm really excited to try them not an ad just enough to brand a lot it's like fix the clock maybe later and it's so nice oh that's a good shot I

water oh wow very soothing kind of like the only pussy condom on your eyes comfortable oh yo not have actually picked up and take my big book pretty well I'm now going to wash my face with my coma gel or it's very lightweight like kind of a loser the whole point of this range is basically hydrate our skin on we were learning the difference between dry skin and dehydrated in today and these new products have helped keep the moisture in you know when you know you know life product feeling that no no no only hydrating booster okay that sounds nice is all this really lightweight really easy to use on the cushion plan perhaps I really like this I'm quite loyal to God in my funnel water and what if I go like have a water the better I have Jason confinement it feels lighter and easier than you

that doesn't go on display I keep it behind my TV is for me and my memories and I just really love pins so yeah so let's show you my board and it's a bit like this so I used to be part of a pin Club which doesn't exist anymore span on Instagram where you paid five pan a month and they sent your new pin so this is kind of where it started so I bought this one I love this designer peach ish I have another one down here but yes so some of the boards are pin club ones some of them I just really like the backs a limited edition others I just have kept because the design is nice and if I haven't kept the back on them it's just because I didn't really care too much about the backs but I also have the actual backs to the pins behind here and a little clear pouch so if I do ever want to like sell them on or and clip them to myself like on my clothes or bag or whatever than I can some of them have been gifted to me from subscribers some have been gifted from brands I've got some PGI Friday ones up here which I got at different TGI Friday stores like that one from Leeds and and then I have like yes some of these ones were from a couple of brands I've got slithering one because I am in Slytherin I've got lots of New York ones so I had to get one of the New York Yankees ones and I loved this Hello Kitty that was in the Disney Store in New York again New York I went to the memorial and the One World Trade Center was not traced on top of the observatory generally like to collect in some places I've been or things I've seen so this one's from Iceland and one of my subscribers sent me this one from Canada you have not been and I really like it but the s if something's have been given to me which is equally as nice but I genuinely like to keep places where I've been I've got one from Greece on my friend Dion down there as well that was almost fun Cheryl I love Disney ones obviously and used to work at Jimmy's iced coffee so I've got a couple there and one of my subscribers Gary who I met in Brighton he sent me a Brighton Pier badge which I love because I didn't pick one up when I was there these are all from New York as well I love the Disney ones and I got some from Park recently and I got these ones of a girl on Twitter this one was so much bigger than I thought it was going to be a little so pretty that was from my friend Eleanor recently then G between this one when we went to see an atom and love it I've also got the teddy bear which is Ricky and he found these ones in his like memories box and stuff and he said I could have them he found he said I've got some pins lying around somewhere and they say 75 years with Mickey so they're going to go on my board in a second and but yeah I really like it I've got a couple of miscellaneous like bits here as well from when I won infosys Choice Award at the Cosmo Awards awesome a little thankyou card and my bad from the clay show but none of those are like relevance opinions but you get the idea so this is what it currently looks like again like I said it's not a display thing it's just kind of a bit of fun they know where I'm going to put these two probably like in the corner here or something but yeah I'm gonna pop those on and that is my pin board my goodness there is so much to do lessons I've learned I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed however I'm getting that I've got four lists on the go at the moment bollock work one my freelance stuff work to Brogan Tait YouTube blog emails admin stuff like admin washing ironing tidying washing up collecting my travel money and change the bedding all that stuff and then a packing list of everything I need to pack and I started shocking everything I want to take me to crazy on the floor which is created more of a mess um and I'm just feeling a little bit like oh so much to do eyes the little time is twenty to ten at the moment time is on my side right now so I've just finished up doing a packing video I can't remember laughing a film it's been a manic day I went to my mom's house and have a breakdown because none of my clothes are fitting me I'm actually working on a campaign with a brand which will see very soon about having no holiday hangups and just finding clothes and wearing things that work for you that's Benji let's get them in hi bad but yeah anyway so I'm just get Benji on one sec oh you put sticking out the top I know it came with me without hello somebody's on Instagram page say if Benji coming with you I'm sure that was then she's not coming with me because any of this is that before we learn B it's a blocky thing you are Brody's anything you come on the next one sorry the honorees are on Jews but to the format Benji we already did our little haul a and also I actually think it's really healthy and really important to travel by yourself and do you think myself like hopefully we'll have a lifetime of holidays currently we are absolutely we have got a bucket list of places we want to go but anyway so what I'm saying is whisper mums had a meltdown borrowed some of her clothes then I wouldn't got my money my Croatian Kuna then I went to I was in things but I got some dinner and and then I've been home and doing a packing video and honesty I've been packing for about two hours which is ridiculous but I tried everything on have dinner in between as well and now I'm dad what's the time on my Bob Bowman to love Island oh right go go bye happy Friday I have spent all day editing this weekly vlog and then filming a beard I'm working with a brand a brand I really love it's one of my biggest

another main term video this week I did have a pack with me but I'm ground to editing it and I actually have a better idea and I might do a unpack with me I don't know if I'll be able to but I might do like a little cabin tour and show you all my things I'll show you what clothes I bought but either way I realized that the packing video was pretty much identical to Tenerife so I haven't done that this week and there won't be one next week with the week you're watchin is either but then next Monday I think I'm going to have a different video and for camping I've been working on and then I can edit the meditators book and I'll be up later next week if that makes sense either way you're getting out some videos and they're going to be really great I'm really excited and so it it already

Charlotte's live streaming so actually been listening to her Metro morning it's Tuesday I mean I'm really good Mead I'm really excited I'm going to home since today with my mum but first I've got to do my social media things I normally work 8 to 1 but I've been up since 6:00 a.m. is 10 to 7:00 so I might start at 7:00 until 12:00 and then put my makeup on get dry and go to home sans I'm working

refresh the place and I'm just excited for this so yes it's been in the diary and I'm doing today with my mum anyway last night was lovely we watched me and Chelsea went to bed quite early really were both knackered from the weekend and Benji left up a whole five this mine so I was kind of tossing and turning them to such to wake up at 6 so I'm gonna have some breakfast and start my work and it's gonna be a good day like it's gonna be a good week actually I'm very very busy this week I've straightened my hair washed and dried it last night but it was very frizzy so I put some hair straightness to it this morning so it's looking a bit fresher and I think most want to have to tell you at the moment I'm feeling much better this week I'm off from a period now a lot of you were really sweet on the vlog last night saying I hope you're feeling better now and you will liked my little motivational chat about maybe treasure shifts and pounds for Florida and I realised after last night a lot of you said to me you might have lost enthusiasm actually there's one girl that basically said she might have lost enthusiasm but you've gained confidence in your work and your relationship love happiness and a better social life like I've gained so many other things so I have to start think about it in that respect that yeah okay okay need some pounds and I've lost some enthusiasm for going to the gym but hey I'm happy and that's what's more important maintaining a healthy and happy lifestyle is actually harder than it sounds I've realized this it's actually not always easy to get the balance right all the time and it's okay if you're struggling you know it's okay if you're feeling like you can't do it all because no one can do it all whatever you define us all you know I mean like I'm trying to do so many things and my work life and career life is going very well at the moment my relationships very happy and great and so if I'm but on a few pounds because of that then I well like I can shift them at the end the day it's only me that can do that and it's easy to do really just a bit of a mind game sometimes but anyway it's very hot in this flat so I'm gonna the window last night bending I made sure everything was like nice and tidy before going to bed and I just really appreciate it because there's nothing worse than waking up and starting the day with a messy flat so pop it all away it's currently a 5 past 11 and I am whizzing through my work I was on the sofa I've just moved to my desk as my back was hurting I am gonna get an iMac at some point I didn't actually finish explaining in last week's vlog I went and looked at some I did a bit of a recce and I've looked at the refurbished ones on the Apple website as well and some of you have told me that there is actually a new Mac coming at the end of the year but it's gonna be ridiculous money so I have also looked at the possibility of having a screen and plugging in with a HDMI cable into my Mac but I do need like a separate place in case my Mac my laptop fails and also this doesn't have good enough RAM and memory space so it's not fast enough for everything I want to do all the time it's good form the go and it keeps me going for now but it's not great for long term so I am basically saving for an iMac at the moment and I'm gonna get one hopefully within the next month or so two moments maybe I don't know if a boot for after Disney it really depends on when my money comes in cuz obviously I work freelance so yes it's really satisfying roasting my list and taking everything off it just makes me feel so much better and also I forgot I got sent some pearbook stuff the other day so I have three bits to show you so I'll do that after I finish this I've done my work I'm ready I'm just picking up my bag I thought I'd show you the appear box things I got sent very kindly I don't expect anyone to send me anything but I love receiving your letters and I often get them delivered to me every couple of weeks my PA box stuff goes to a peanut books in Liverpool when my management are and then they collect it when I have a few bits and send it down so I had three things the first one was a really lovely little letter this is from a girl called Sophie Edward she has an Instagram called seamstress Sophie Edward and she broke the nicest letter to me so thank you so much Sophie and she also

show you this because this is my peer box a dress not my home address but look how beautiful that is and then it says sending love from Allison and there was a Pluto sticker a very apt card that says I love New York and she's awesome milk and open it and I was like wow so first of all there are some stickers and there's a really cute Alice pin like the rabbit Alice in Wonderland there we go so it's like an Alice in Wonderland pin I cannot wait to put that on my pin board and then she has done the most beautiful card look at that she's even got a little bee up here because that's my nickname B but she just went to say hello it's such a beautiful card so thank you so much Allison I absolutely loved it and I showed bench and he was like wow that's so nice so thank you very much the last

but this is my own natural curly hair I'm off to the gym this morning just having a bowl of cereal and I'm gonna do a little workout and maybe go for a swim I'm also gonna weigh myself to see if I've lost any pounds at all I don't know if I will have or if I've remained under now I'm starting to like I don't know I get too caught up in the numbers but they have a proper body tracks machine at my gym that does all your body fat mass and all the percentages so we'll see tonight Benji and I are going out for drinks with some of our friends it's my friend Adams birthday and some of you might know my friend Georgie so it's her boyfriend but I would school without them so that'd be really nice so we're doing that tonight tomorrow we've got a barbecue for one of Benji's cousins it's their birthday and then tomorrow night we're going out again with some of Benji's friends who are now obviously my friends so that's Saturday night and then Sunday we have like a rough idea of some pounds but I'm not 100% sure yet so make it for the weekend it should be quite nice and it's a nice day it's sunny it's good for the earth show but I just want to get my workout in and listen to some music and yeah I've got a video going up today which I did yesterday so that's good I don't need to film what edit today and that's what I have to tell you right karaoke time and a place on my favorite tune music if you were back in jail then so hi crying I love the beginning of this so she gave blinky Nicky day game ready ready no you wanna see me naked Wow I got this for Gabby's Channel Gabby in your chains recommendation Berlin this traffic is just horrific I've been waiting to this point for so long it's Hoppus 12 and I had an amazing morning actually I feel so good now I weighed myself on the proper body tracks machine so I'm using that as my guide because if I use different scales and it says different things then it's not going to be as accurate so I lost five pounds last week which is crazy I don't know no actually lost that much but my goal is to now lose eight pounds in days so I was like 2 pounds a week which is very durable so that put me in a good mood then I did an hour of cardio it's about 20 minutes swim in the outside pool and then I went and sat in a Jacuzzi hot tub thing and I did some emails and Instagram and I've got lots going on at the moment so I basically did a load of work for my phone which is good and then I had a shower and I've washed dried and straightened my hair which took about half an hour it's so thick at the moment like it's so thick and heavy so I'm gonna have it cut before I go to Florida just to trim and just to have some layers put in it I've also been thinking about maybe getting my nails done and my eyebrows done so all things I need to start considering I'm about to pull into Tesco I've written a little list of things that I want back from Tesco and they have some really good offers on in there so I thought I'd do a little food fall it's just kind of a topup oh really or pizza I wanted and needed so the first thing actually went into the clothing section as I was looking for a few last bits and outfits for Florida I saw these in the sale I tried them on and they looked so cute so I got myself a pair of dungarees but it's a dungarees dress so it was in my size it was originally 20 pounds in the cell 210 and then it's scanned up at 7 pounds fits me so nicely and I just sit with a disney top and some trainers this is gonna be a really cute little outfit for Florida so I think I'm almost there with my outfits now I'm gonna be repeating a few but obviously I'm not gonna different outfit every single day but I've got quite a few bits for Florida now sand income almost there but anyway so soft fluffy little loaf of bread let his stuff we got some rocket and a mixed big bag of leaves things just half the cucumber because they never eat a whole one peppers I've really start to like happen so some of those a bow lots of packets of the Tesco everyday value battle mix for pancakes my whisk dives so bought a new whisk tinfoil a humongous box of fish fingers because I just love fish finger sandwiches raspberries

vain' I can't even hold the bag up it's in this massive Primark bag it's so heavy because I bought unheardof gifts for Christmas what is this I'm not feeling my hair anyway I'm going to lush so I'll show you that in a main Channel video so keep it up for that maybe later this week as you're watching this I'm gonna try and film it later this because I'm filming it but it should be up later whatever you get a dress watching what was in my zoo Ella bag my goodie bag because who doesn't love a goodie bag haul the novelty never wears off when you're so kindly given things in a goodie bag and I always get so excited I'm like oh what is so already a little rummage and I'm very excited so so let's talk about the canvas bag itself it actually does say zoella on it and then on this side find the beauty in everyday in a quote so don't if that's like a quote from Zoe but very cute first thing is a stationary asset which is very festive and nice I love this I love the colors they've chosen for this collection is gone off like floor like my flawless leaf print and gold and green spots and I really am digging it a lot I really like this say that's about 12 pounds I think yep 1250 it's a boots gifts at another boots gift set is the cozy vibes bug this was 8 pound 15 a chance to explain it but you know when we had hot chocolate they let us put all our toppings on her staff that was like legit chocolate like melted chocolate it was like pop hot chocolate and when I'm not holding this up still when I go skiing at Christmas I didn't go last year but for a lot of the last 10 years I've skied at Christmas and we always have a hot chocolate break on the slopes and in Italy in France they have the nicest thick proper hot chocolates and to me that is one of my highlights of like Christmas skiing and that to me is a really solid memory and to have the hot chocolate today just took me back you know when you like taste something what eat something or smell something and it just takes you to that place that's what happened to me today so I loved the hot chocolate very much because it just reminded me of skiing and being all Snuggie and Christmasy and snowy and I loved it so got a nice little cozy vibe smoked this was really cute I like the color inside this I could dark green so there were two lifestyle bits and then I got to beauty bits which I'm very excited about the first one is the body mists snow Ella which I've sprayed on me twice today I like it so much I'm not just saying this because I've actually tried quite a lot of the Zoe stuff now and I could probably list you my top five things I like from all this all the different collections I wasn't a massive fan of the jelly and gelato spray the last one I've got them all I've got all the sprays now just a bit crazy but I do have them all by far my favorite super nice I don't know what's in it I thought it'd be like sickly Christmassy but it's not it does have like a bit of mint in it but it is just so lovely and I love the little pompom on it so cute so this is definitely gonna be a staple in my life now I love it and I also got the hand cream the winter wonder hand clever winter wonder hand hand cream the packaging is so nice I've really used this tonight on the train home because I love it so much so how much is this snow Ella is 12 pounds and if you only get one thing from the Beauty Collection I'd recommend that and the hand cream is six pounds but they also have like tons of gift sets which I've just perfect presence also so I'd know I have eczema and a lot of stuff irritates me like you know generally but I had this on for like well hours now and it hasn't irritated me so that's a bonus going to bed I had an amazing day so thank you so much to everyone involved I met so many new youtubers and old favorite tummies I vomited to Charlotte Hall today as well outside lush I saw Katie Snooks positive skin just say it's like kind of passing anyway wait for an uber so they really have a chance for I love her so I didn't have the balls to say hi but um I did see Charlotte hole who I obviously went to Benidorm with if you saw that vlog in May that was nice to see how briefly she's so nice she's so sweet and just cool she's got a cool vibe she's like a cool girl fuck her a lot I've now been talking for almost minutes and I look like a proper egghead so I'm literally gonna go to bed now I will see you tomorrow morning lovers my room is a mess so that later but it is eight o'clock I need to start work I'm actually literally getting dressed on camera which is a fast but pajamas on and I'm very very tired today I really want to tell you on taste but hey that's bad and B I don't have Nutella so me I need a glass sisters you don't want my contacts in just yet so let's shut these eyes on everything okay I'll be back later I know that like total trash today I'm pretty aware of that I'm in a really odd mood today can you tell I'm just gonna get some scissors I finished up my freelance a bit so Justin gives a new client actually quite excited about it it's not what it's not that exciting but I'm excited for a new kind of social media account to work on I guess it's just a Facebook page like some of my clients I do Instagram Twitter Facebook Linkedin buddybuddy blah but this new client is just anywho I just had a delivery from new look I was sucked in because they emailed me like three thousand times saying we have 25% off everything and I was like oh okay so I found these beautiful little white lace shorts I wanted Florida put them in my basket happy as Larry then they sold out literally within well the minute I put it in the basket and went two pairs looking at other things then I went to pay within makes five minutes they were gone I'm so annoyed because ASIS hold your stuff for an hour and I'm so used to that that I was disappointed so I binned off me look and I got frustrated and then like three days eight and they were like bragging you still have things in your basket and there's still 25% off so I had a few things in mind I wanted and I have just been paid so I thought I just pick up some bits I didn't spend much money my first thing I got was a blazer I've been watching a new blazer for events which I actually wanted it yesterday but I ended up going with a different outfit anyway but I don't know what this is gonna look like but I really wanted a white cotton blazer but now the Sun is kind of over and I never found one I've gone for one which is basically what I'm gonna learn for like events and dinners and things well I hope it looks all right but it's a what was gray on the website but it's kind of coming up like brown and not sure how I feel about this and it's got these sleeves that I like bell sleeve things it's very thin I don't know how I feel about it unless it looks like on but this was $24.99 boss I got 25% off so that's the first thing a blazer I saw this little dress which I don't need any more clothes Florida like this is definitely gonna have to be done faster impacted by Birds I really liked it I thought well well soon it looks like it was so cheap I think it was like 9 pounds or something in the sale it was originally $24.99 I definitely didn't pay more than a tenner for it but it's like a blue gingham style bow dress oh my goodness I think this is so pretty that's my fish fingers that were on in the and it's got quite a nice thick straps I'm quite looking forward to this but I don't know what it's gonna look like I bought a dress from Munich quite recently my mom's gonna be like screaming at the TV I'll have fun whatever she's watching on and but I'm not having to say sure in it and I had her sew it up for me and take it in and I'm still not sure in it so that's gonna be my replacement dress that I'm justifying it I bought a little black cami just with the discount I thought I needed one of these I actually needed it yesterday with the dresses from yesterday but I was wearing a primal one that has like gold straps luckily you can see them but anyway I thought I'd get one of these anyway got it in a large it was $2.99 but you know discount all that another pair of them spanks I guess but have you been recommending different types to me I like my H&M ones but these were so cheap that it was like silly not to get them they were originally $12.99 I think I paid $4.99 or something with the discount but they're like mesh ones I'm not sure how I feel about this but I thought if I'm really hot and sweaty then I thought they might be quite good I'm not sure I don't know what they're gonna look like but they're just basically really high then they're more for like suck you in tummy stylee I don't know you might hate them but I'm gonna try money waist it's very boring whore I'm not sure about that blaze of the morn looking out at the mall night and not digging it but I will try it on anyway take it out here so far I'd written milk cereal and color I'm doing quite well yay fish fingers I'm a 5 year old yes I'm coming are you cooked yes so excited I also watched dr. Foster this morning I loved it I'm so into the new series I'm ready for like all the drama if you haven't already I do recommend it is very good so now I've put a wash on as well that's what you can hear I'm going to sit on the sofa do my luncheon and then I might try and film the lush stuff maybe I'll see either I go and go to the gym or I can film what do I feel like doing not sure yet Halle keeps you updated I am burning the spiced pumpkin that candle from my home cents haul and it smells insane in this flat so speaking of that hole I've just published it I've had an amazing response so far you guys are so supportive and lovely so if you haven't seen my home scents haul then I'll link it below I filmed a video unless it's been on or what's coming off now I've done a lush haul from yesterday that's gonna be coming up later this week so that's now done so I'm ahead of myself I normally film videos that I upload that week but I'm actually ahead of myself so I'm feeling quite good so that's done I'm just uploading it on the thumbnail I'm gonna write the description and then Benji's coming over and he texted me today saying he was having a bad day and I was like you know I'm not really in the grace of moods if I'm being honest and he was like should we just have a takeaway and being our cozies tonight and I was like melt my heart little bells like yeah I can't wait here's our table bring Fish and Chips round so morning oh it's Thursday I feel like I say the same thing every time I start a new day but I've got fresh pajamas on I've just found these ones in the drawer and they're really soft just catching up with Louise and voice has gone hmm I'm having a thins bagel with tuna and I've cut up some pepper yellow pepper and cucumber mixed in a bit of mayo I've just finished up my work I've done a so a blog post from Tuesday the lifestyle Christmas collections if you want to have a look about our link that below for you all the pictures and things I quite chop with it took me about an hour hour and a half but it's done now that's me mouths done some add mini bits starting another blog post which I'm gonna carry on this evening go to a collect plus place to return my new look parcels so I'm just trying to find the nearest one bigass because I want to get some command hooks I've got a couple of things I want to put on the wall and I tried to drill them in I'm almost wrecked the rule wet rat gun will wreck the wall oh god that was quite hard to say rekt the wall anyway so I'm gonna try get command hooks and I'm gonna have a little movie and I was done gonna be honest I just really don't like about home yet I just feel like having some human interaction and seeing other things other than the four walls around my flat I think I can't do more than like two days there before full any time I have to get out so I'm gonna just go and do a little browsing I love browsing the supermarket but I'm probably going to come out of more than just command hooks but all see any some almond milks well run at bat and well so I need I think that's it so muchi and asta back from Asda I didn't really get anything worth showing you just some floor white won't flow out some normal wipes my command hooks I've got some clear ones for Benji's have a towel in the bathroom and these ones for photo frames I got myself a tape measure cause I don't have one it's really boring so the birthday cause I'm at normal cards and I also picked up this little cookbook is for students it says student males shoot males so I'm gonna go through that with Benjy tonight see there's anything nice in there we can make it look quite nice I flipped her in the shop I finally put this back on the wall if you follow me for a long long time you'll know that this has travelled with me to all the houses I've lived at I got on ebay yonks ago literally like three or four years ago and I am going to make it as you can see it's very bare at the moment I'm gonna make it like my Disney shrine if you like which might seem quite sad to some people but I have lots of Disney or on my house or flat whatever but like the door shuts like this and so you won't be able to see it a lot of time it's just kind of there for me I know it's kind of silly but so far I've got my symptoms I've got a little chip I've got a card that my friend Ellen that gave me I've got two like this actually I've got a chip and I've got another Christmas decoration chip so I don't think that mistakes it doesn't really fit there and doesn't quite fit on the Shelf either but for a minute it was

on Friday night we've arranged to go bowling with a couple of our friends they're like Benji's family friends and we haven't really had any chance to do anything with them yet there's six of us so we organized that having the diary from like a month ago the rest of the week is gonna be pretty chatty and homey I finished the vlog yesterday afternoon uploaded it and I've done the thumbnail everything so I don't have to worry about that today sometimes I don't finish it on a Sunday but because I allocated some time on it on Friday but got it all done last night so that was really nice like it's nice to be ahead of yourself and I've got a lush haul ready to go later this week too so I'm feeling less pressured and stress to get everything done this week I'm feeling quite chilled like

they're children Dorothee a manila manila manila that's little boy oh my god they are adorable and it just reminds me of Fraser and I when we were kids they're just the most beautiful family and they travel together and they've seen all these beautiful amazing things around the world and they're just amazing so I'm going to link them below if you want to see bloggers especially in Disney but they've done loads of other videos and they're just amazing so I know I'm silly I know I'm silly but it was just cute I've got my second wash on I've got a nice fridge full of food today which is great my hello fresh box just arrived again I've I bought one this time so I worked with them recently and I've just bought another one so that's good and I've got to take the recycling out and that rubbish and I'm also just washing the bin because something leaked in it and it smells really gross this is adulting at its finest I've hung all this washing as well now then when I'm done I'm gonna

obviously and now we're gonna watch a new show starting on my TV at 9 o'clock say I don't know what it's like all it's called I take tomorrow if it's any good but yes I've had a very productive day no reply to all my comments so far so good so much been so lovely Oh liar it's called liar I'll see you tomorrow good morning happy Tuesday I'm going into the office tomorrow for the company I work for and I'm gonna be working till 3:00 there tomorrow so they've asked me to come in and I think we're having lunch together and staff having a bit of a meeting and catch up because I'm also gonna be away for two weeks so we're just like preplanning for my time off as well but anyway I'm tuned in to good morning Britain because my friend Henry is gonna be on it long story short growing up we had some family friends called the phrases the four children with four boys and they're all their surnames for Fraser so those William Thomas Henry and Dominic and Henry now paralyzed from the neck down actually their surname phrases where we got my brother's name from I've known them my whole life and in fact his brother was my first kiss have you know I'm friends with his mom on Facebook and she has put my face this morning but he's on some weight hey go are so excited to watch him I haven't seen him in years like a really long time but everything changed during the holiday with friends to Portugal instant dive into the sea he hit his head on a sandbag damaging his spinal cord was left him paralyzed for the shoulders down in the eight years that followed his desire to focus on what he could do rather than what include led him to public speaking and rediscovering his love of painting now supported by JK Rowling these details his incredible journey the book hoping to inspire others with me now lovely to see you this morning Henry the book is the little big things honestly Henry you're such a remarkable person yeah you know you've been named on the power 100 list is one of the top 10 most influential people living with a disability in the country you're such an accomplished talented painter and your outlook on life is as I said you know a constant inspiration to know many other people is terrific having you on the program this morning all the best we've booked the little big things and the subtype of the booking young man's belief that every day can be because he's just such a nice person oh my god it just makes you appreciate your own life and can you imagine an accident happening like that's you and changing your life like oh my god he's just so positively never moans and I just think we don't realize what we've got enough I think sometimes it's so easy to moan about what we don't have rather than appreciating what we do have right now and that our life is so good as it is as people and a society pushing us the next level and I think that's so important to try and push yourself and excite exceed your expectations and work hard and I sometimes just feel so overwhelmed with the pressure to complete the next thing or what's next I've talked about this before where it just feels that you're running a hundred miles an hour sometimes and it's really important to just take it slow and realize that actually life is what you make it and Henry is a true inspiration and example of that really really emotional it's 10 past 9:00 and I'm ready got a bit makeup on for once which feels nice my hair is just doing its own things I'm also gonna get it done I'm gonna pat my go to my mom's house because I'm working on a video and I need her help with it

can a bedroom like prick a spare bedroom yeah put a sink proper ill I felt like a salon shed a lovely little spaniel called Baxter seriously weird yeah love it it feels really nice I can't dry my hair like this either so I love it when it's like this okay yeah love it I'm back from my mom's house it's quite naughty I was working for a while it's now half past six and I'm gonna do my fresh dinner tonight it looks so really nice well actually this is a creamy chicken pie and it's got all got potato leek celery mushrooms chicken stock pot double cream cheddar cheese bread crumbs and olive oil this does look good so partly it's a customer favorite I'm not sponsored by hello freshers week genuinely bought it genuinely liked it so I will show you when I've done it oh dear so we had a little bit of an accident in the kitchen and she was cutting the leeks I went to bend the ends and it happened so fast didn't it Musa and he accidentally cut my shopping shopping shopping it's because I said it happened too quickly to like explain but I said no need to cut it you cut the middle and then I said let's me nice cut the end off and you went yeah and then you listed the knife off it I thought you'd stop so then I put my finger down either not as I did I set up food up in knees and then as I did you put the knife down again so both of us didn't know each other's next move because we weren't that far ahead anyway I'll be fine like uranium so anyway but that drama over Benji has been for the last 45 minutes making the dinner how amazing it looks you were right the small dish was the right size that looks right in comparison to the picture though it isn't it this is very square like that always get more square mentions whereas this is also right oh it's gonna taste amazing though morning welcome back to Wednesday now I'm starting like at 10 o'clock until 3:00 today so I'm actually going into the office so the company I work for I quite like it a bit more chilled and it breaks up my weeks and lets me have some human interaction and I'm allowed to go there whenever I want so if I wake up on week I'm like I don't want to be in the flat then I can go to the office I have a desk there so yeah it's a spare desk not my desk it's a spare desk but there's a desk for me what should I talk about first I'll talk about the finger first I'm feeling better today I had lots of paracetamol last night and I had it bandaged up so then she bashed up to me but I've just taken off it looks well it looks like this so I don't know if you can like properly see that that's nail varnish I don't like befool does not blood but the dark bit obviously is blood so the knife went through the nail and through the skins underneath it really really her obviously cried a lot I have zero pain threshold like I even like scratches and grazes hurt me so obviously I didn't take to it very well I think it was the shock more than anything I think maybe I should just stay out the kitchen I think she did with the cooking the dinner last night was amazing it was by far the best hellofresh meal and maybe even the nicest dinner we've had in weeks so I scoffed it and it was great because I could just use my right hand and I was like scoffing the dude I was so so hungry and loved dicks I missed lunch yesterday yeah so anyway then we watched bakeoff and then we got to talk to foster so good TV night actually and bakeoff was actually quite enjoyable but I was saying on Twitter that I really missed the history bits I don't know if that makes me a bit of a geek and a lot of people on Twitter like no they were boring I'm glad they're gone oh that's my fame some people like the history but other people's that they're boring but obviously they've taken them out for the adverts now but I thought they were quite interesting I liked learning about where the product came from that which country came from and things like that so yeah I missed that bit but I knew there was something missing about Bake Off but anyway I still enjoyed it I'm dr. Forster was really good last night I'm trying to work out why Tom would move back in with his dad like I'm pretty sure Simon has basically bribed him in some way but I don't know why yet it all looks a bit officially at the moment so I'm looking forward to next week so if you're not watching dr. Foster already get on it I'm still loving my hair this morning I mean I slept on it so it's not looking as pretty so I had to like click this front bit up because it's gone on like too flicky this

surprise because I always overpack but I'd rather have too many options than not enough but it's just really hard to know in advance what to take because we haven't really made that many plans so don't know what we're going to be doing so I don't know what to pack and I don't know but and today so far I've just been editing videos getting work done before we head off because I'm I'm going to try and treat this as much of a holiday as I possibly can I do have a few things that work things to do when I'm out there and but in terms of like editing and stuff I just want to keep that to a minimum so I've just been in all day basically and yeah just trying to decide now what to take so hung up a few just as hair that I think I will probably be taking I love this one my Ted Baker and yeah there's a few other little cute dresses in there as well I love this top so I bought from a sauce really really sweet but this is the issue I have going on right now I haven't actually perhaps many clothes I've packed my gym stuff bikinis and toiletries and bags and shoes and all of like my electronic stuff but no real clothes and it is pretty useful I was going to say pretty much full it is full and all of that is meant to get in here so this could be interesting but before I start with all of that look what how a bride softbox yeah and I feel like I haven't done an unboxing video on

couple of those out from the box we've also got that she wore so this one is very so if you like normal fizzy drinks at lemonade's and cokes and stuff like that this is just a really good alternative we've dr. edamame mix high in protein we have got some freezedried pineapple we always love the freezedried fruit in closed box and some watermelon seeds and I love them because you don't normally

Wembley Cup I'd be in a lot of trouble and so we've proposed it but it is going to happen unless you prefer that we just go in there because when we go out to Division three we're going to play with this Sunday the clamp and as a mark of respect from farmers and they are a good team 15 goon alright and we thought we want to work our way up through a Newton you haven't played the other long time crooks you were quite new we're going to stop in that first there was some dating soon we're playing it's sort of trying to get teams hard and hard as we progress and Parliament is going to be a real test so we want to work up to it I think when we do do it'll be a nice event hopefully we get some of you guys down to what you're in an organization yeah but yeah just to confirm Palmer's versus hash that night is going to happen and we're going to win it where's the way and see that's the way to say I'm sure you think your boys are going to win I think what I've always can do it I think we could win it hashtag United turn up I don't know what tricks you've got up your sleeve I don't know if you're going to bring along like a kingpin one you might need to make mark no mistakes gotta go right handed them round they don't need that confirm or I'm told you as much as well I said let's sign for Wickham you're not going to get the cheese for cone elsewhere that's right enjoy the rest of the game I couldn't see you at the matchup soon a new shot he sent people look at ok second off to kick it off got a few substitutions he Gwaine he's on the pitch the eventers which is dangerous Antonio has moved up the pitch for us Pegula's got off we've got resources on reefs per quod little bit youngsters so we'll see how we get on their beds for the ball in here you've a get rid of it boys it all James Collins backwards as well I was out of hand at that and you had Antonia getting a chance to go further forward as well DK will get himself golf probably the right thing to do because he's gonna get injured any second so we've shown five six minutes left and they've scored a goal because ours are the glider that stupid but in Pendleton euros I think resource would constantly be a little bit more outlaw over the top three two new base to the point it's all over free to defeat shame but only a friendly lots of positive to take from that main one being nd Carol getting two goals against Juventus there's some good players playing obviously hit ye didn't get a goal 75 million controlled by James Collins you know I'll take that the main thing is the competitive games that you're openly the Premier League there the games we have to win and I'm seeing good signs and we still haven't lost a competitive game at London Stadium said what did you think your first experience the new stadium I really enjoyed it mate is absolutely brilliant to walk out there we see the clamor everywhere one lobbies concerns was wouldn't look like a West Ham stadium it definitely does and yeah we lost a game for me the biggest positive is that Jimmy pyar has turned up for work this year come on he's always got a turn up for work when it's not soccer well we just found these two hashtag mugs stay by for the game what do you think of the stadium Stephens I think it's lovely why I'm just saying it's a signal on social media saying that you know the sting seemed a lot further away and there on the bowling but I think the atmosphere still there did forget taking far away so I love it you're always someone who's kind of dillydally between football teams so you can be get your West Ham fan I was like oh it's which did win 4 at the weekend so I'm going to stick with them until they lose but when they do lose might come over watch this space good to know good to know Manji obviously you're an Arsenal fan we're not going to convert you anytime soon although you were Man United fan when you're a kid I remember that quite what do you think of the new stadium good stadium gray Stadium actually structurally sound all the key areas delivered great atmosphere when I go to watch Aston why normally get me a peace and quiet I can hear myself thinking there so it could get any work done hopefully they're not for you because I enjoyed the game a good atmosphere I can see you guys being very happy there so I think you've done really well good location and great shops and restaurants later so she goes home for them yes well I just got home in time towards the end of the Community Shield final sores left hand scores last minute ish winner for Man United's so d symptoms at hand I want to show you something now get your opinion on it you may have seen the kit we are wearing in today's games and Luke is like a third kid it's a commemorative kit now it looks like this it's blue it's got a color you may notice is a different different badge to normal West town that's because it stands for Thames ironworks FC it's all about the history of West all started I got your group of guys he worked in a factory essentially coulda Thames ironworks that's why we called the ions and this was the original badge looks like so this is harking back to that I still may be responsible I bet way the same as our other kids we the sponsors a little bit harder to see there's a bit of a different style but I want to see what you guys think of it cuz I have made my mind up as to whether I like it or not yet I mean I definitely like the fact that we're remembering our roots and I like it as a top I'm not sure about it's a football shirt though I thought was more like a polo shirt but I don't know let me know in the comments below what you think of this new commemorative kit anyway guys that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed it drop a like on the video if you have subscribed for more hopefully that's a sort of caliber team we'll be seeing at London stadium more often you know if we do one in the Europa League maybe a few years when they'll be in the Champions League we'll play you V through in a competitive game who knows I hope so though I hope so see you next time don't go changing"	2306

immunizations that one that you do at one here I'm just going fishing through all these red books no actually no it's real when you have three red books from the UK you know what these are like the health records and stuff so I've got that and I feel like I haven't vlogged in a few days I'm sure the last thing I vlogged was an event I spoke out which is a ton of fun but now it's back to mommy life and I'm going through my planner because that's pretty much how I function people that have you organize your life three kids I have a planner now since in school it's like a ton of newsletters

settling in school but for now it's it's been it's been pretty intense but this week should be a lot more fun for vlogging the twins have their birthday party coming up which I've been planning for a while because I decided to invite pretty much everyone from their reception class just so I can get to know the moms and you know these are completely new people for the twins as well and there's some close family friends as well so we've got that coming up and also what else today should be interesting as well because I've got the kids dental appointment and they're not seeing me they're gonna see another okay that is actually my alarm which is telling me that I need to go out and that's pretty much how I try and stay on top of everything because caleb has an appointment now like I said so he's got his oneyear point of saying he's headed to the doctor's that were not late I've seen a bit hello so we've just finished with Caleb's appointment he just had this vaccination and cuz I've done this quite a few times I still get super super emotion on each time because you know this is going so happy and he's also excited when they're Lucy's new people and I knew he knew something was up when I was like trying to hold him down and they had about four injections and his legs and oh it's it's always so describe it I just get really emotional each time they have to have it done by know it's important and look they're fine afterwards he's got a few places on his leg as well so things to look out for obviously things like you know just feeling a little bit more tired see a temperature as well he had the temperature on his first vaccination but he hasn't had one since beyond didn't keep an eye out for that and how are you doing buddy you see I so quiet without the twins just me and my baby me and Caleb trying cause the twins actually at my mom's because my cousin is there at the moment so they haven't like a massive play date in the house with their cousins as well it's been kind of nice just having one than one time my not so little man just cry so so quickly yeah so I'm just gonna head over there I'm sure the car will be a lot louder very very soon I just picked up to my auntie oh my cousin Lee my cousin's gonna come my auntie my cousins I know all right and you see like this before but the joys the seven seas aside without picking up their twins who were right in the back and they RKO'd all my kids are asleep it's only okay so these are my second cousins I could say and this is little David and his little sister comfort how do we know they're five and nine Ramos they've had a lot of fun playdate with their cousins have you had fun with the twins yes do you like hanging out with them are you excited to go back to school so they're going today so they just pick

private guys and now it's princess Olympia Stern look Raymond okay No so it is what's at 36 minutes past midnight and we all still awake because Caleb just threw up all over the bed we are closely peeping right now you just throw up everywhere guys all over me all over Sam's I've had to take off my top pants I'm not showing myself right now but at least you can see my bottom half my leggings which are completely covered in sick right now it's not a pretty sight so I'm just gonna clear up this area I just I quickly just vlog this just let you knows well he is fine he's downstairs with Sam so I'm just trying to rock him back to sleep and settle him because also he heals a little bit you know overwhelmed with everything as we all were it's just a 24hour bug going around he doesn't need to go into A&E thankfully just because the fact is another temperature may be symptoms like that yeah so my current situation is just cleaning the bed and so I can move everything so up everywhere guys the headboard the walls the table everything joys of having white things but um yes I've taken off all that and then when I'll shine take him out of the room he then sew up again all over the floor so it's my current situation right now just trying to clean the floor put some baking powder down and I'm just spraying it with a little bit of vinegar and water and I'll work that in see if I can take away the bulk of the stains so I guess I'm just showing this because just to show the reality of parenting life guys that is not over these days is not all always hashtag family life hashtag family goals sometimes you don't sleep sometimes kids get sick and then this situation in both Sam and I have worked as well especially samia's work in the morning he breaks up extra early so he breaks up at 5:00 for work and it's ready midnight so it's probably only to get about three hours sleep but yeah like so this is I guess the reality of parenting life we all go through it I'm just in the clear this up and then we're all gonna get back to it I carry the sick ball around with us in case he shows up again hey guys so I'm caroling in the twins room caleb is finally down for a nap and well guys how they sounded pretty pretty rough recently because they just thought it would be something that passes by in just like a 24hour bug but it dragged on for quite a bit and we're not going to see the doctor any of the medication because there's nothing too serious I did question if it was to do with you know Caleb recently having his vaccinations and he said there is a possible link between the two you can't get those side effects when greatest out of the vaccinations like the vomiting and he has temperature as well but you just assured this is something that will pass pretty soon so we just keep an eye on him and just let make sure he gets the rest that he needs so you know the entry mommy mode they thought okay baby started and now this is time I can just do all the castilian things on my todo list and then I just heard the Holy Spirit sing Bibiana stop and I've heard it's so clearly but then I was thinking oh God you know I really need to just get this stuff darling just shiny reasonable God's about why he can't spend time with him or they just never never seems to be a good time I just heard it again so I just stopped doing pants and worship music grab my scripture and just you know meditated and I taped it on a few a few verses just yeah give you that energy in that strength you need and then one thing I was also able to do is I've been trying to study the book of Job recently and I've actually finally able to finish it today it seemed like the longest chapters but it didn't take me too long to just round it off today and I also wanted to share with you some things I learnt from it because it will put my heart to go through this and I never really knew why at first until you know some things happen recently in our family and our close circle of friends we recently lost somebody very close to us and we haven't had a loss like this in a while and just I hold it together because today's actually achieve a funeral and then yeah it's just time to feel a lot more real and so going through this your life radiant before I'm sure we all know the book of Job this guy who's pretty much everything that he's still whose face it it really hit home the message a lot better to me now especially when you're going through something yourself so I just wanna share with you some of the things some of the things all put my heart to share today and I just really hope encourage someone who's going through a similar season or just know someone who's going through something similar so I use this Bible which is the NLT version and it was Jo 42 that really stuck out to me in the last chapter verse 12 and it says so the Lord blessed Jove in the second half is life even more than in the beginning it just says all the things like the world bursting with and it reminds me of some leverage in John before where Jesus says you know in this life you will have many Charles and tests and tribulations but take heart for either from the world and this just this beautiful message of the fact that the truth is the fact that we are going to go through things in life life is not always perfect but you know it's also a message of the fact that God is such a great God is a God of restoration I'm gonna round this off real quick I just know I flew this message it's for somebody if I want to say you know God surely does care about your story and what you're going through is important to him and secondly you know you may see your circumstance but God's purpose his plan is so much bigger and better than you I could ever ever imagine so you know just don't don't give up and the last thing I want to say on this is the in life when situations and circumstances are battling for our hearts we must remember to fix our eyes on the Lord and not on the situation and not on the life of the enemy I believe that in doing so will realize how powerful he is and also just the fact that nothing is beyond his control so you hope that you tried to someone and yeah we're about to head out I feel a bit it's winter here this Ernestine so you need to pick them up from school pick them up every yes because we have a feel today about very very close family friends from the situation where you feel like they were taken too soon but I said we know we know we know God knows best sevens here hey baby so we are now heading to the reception caleb is with my motherinlaw Sam's mom at the moment she we just came down from Nigeria recently and we also got a call today with some really exciting news my brother and my sisterinlaw in pretty much in leave not my brother but my sister must be much in labor right now they're quite far away there's just an intersection for a bit and then head over to my brother I'm going to feed my nephew so in silence really maybe strange time right now I woke up this morning no we just had and now I know we have a few no Oh Mama's here hey it's the hospital to see my sisterinlaw Tama and me the baby it's just a waiting game now well I'm so funny she's hoping the baby will come on her birthday because her birthday September as well we want to share with you G look like your grandfather five children my baby you got your baby you have to cream to go your baby then you better get bigger and bigger and bigger and the baby comes out not enough I speak the birds and the bees chat again we'll save the nasties for like you know 15 years so we've had to leave the hospital consumers it's progressing in their own time baby boy is definitely taking his time there his three time the kids are getting a little bit Restless it's way way past their bedtime and we still need to get baby Caleb so they had tired of them we will be seeing him very very soon I'll smoke with never see her you stole my heart what is it that you do my life was great you added colors very good mood today very excited since it's been a very busy week I should probably be quite exhausted right now and how long this vlog is gonna be but this is the last event which is going to be my baby so I guess it's not really babies anymore but the kids birthday parties which I've been planning for quite a while my party's is actually quite intense kids birthday parties so what we're doing is is the twins 4th birthday party and been a lot of cheeky as walkers I've kind of combined it with Caleb's as well I know ok I've actually turned in one two months before the twins so this is a very belated birthday party but we did do something for him something very small just a small family gathering and then I was going to transfer to album for their first birthday party I was like it was almost like a mini wedding we did for those kids I don't know if it's you know the whole idea cuz you know wait you're about and having twins and also our first pregnancy and everyone just just contributed and helped out was just planning the event so it just ended up being a lot bigger more extravagant like it ever imagined for a kid's birthday party and I just thought to myself okay Lib you know third child problems where he's gonna have such a small event for his so we kind of just thought it would be a good idea to combine those there birthday parties so I did was I just hide that this building was soft play and got kids entertaining that and face painter a little bit of decoration and voila you have the makings for kids just run around and have fun and get exhausted and hopefully sleep afterwards so I just want to show you the kids outfits so this is no:1 Caleb's tops and I went for the matchy matchy thing lately I just become pretty obsessed with making Caleb and Noah match it's just been so much fun even down to the jeans even though these actually from different shops as well I think this next then since we saw something they're actually quite similar so I just need to iron those and then this is Olivia's she wanted a dress of course even though she's worn this dress quite a few times she insisted that she wanted to wear it again so I was like it's your birthday wear whatever you want saves me having to buy a new one and then this is mine I'm just gonna wear em this and carrot op which I really love see I'm just really excited about that got a lot of their school friends coming so just be great to me some new friends for them and meet some of the new mums and then our family's coming sounds parents are going to be there my parents gonna be there a lot of our siblings gonna be there obviously except for my brother and he wife and their new baby but they're doing so well I'm just really really happy and excited for them it's just the safe delivery are too good you know and I love it I love just being an auntie so next thing I'm going to do is comment of the week and that goes to Tammy Kay and she says you're such inspiration or thank you to me you may have mentioned it but how much time do you spend daily weekly doing homeschooling they're going to be head of the pack when they start school so this based off our previous video where we shows you some homeschool activities we've been doing for the twins spending about 10 minutes daily and we do have like a structure to it so they know there's a specific time of the day they are gonna do some homeschooling activities and it doesn't have to be you know just reading a textbook like I showed you in the videos is those interactive stuff it can be playing with the blocks it can be playing with letter cards just so it's a little bit more engaging especially for very young children like turns I've been doing this for quite a while as well and it's nice because considering they are the youngest in their year it's kind of nice to see that they're really quite confident in that area when it comes to reading and writing so I hope that helps and answers that question I will probably try and do more detailed homeschooling videos as well especially with Caleb who's only one but we're doing a few exercises with him as well so I'm gonna get all these clothes ironed because we need to get ready and head out for the kids birthday party it's gonna be turn up Oh hey guys we are back from the party and my sister love is here hey she is with my nephew haha party a week like a gazelle say I'm gonna do like a fight with it yeah have the on the naming ceremony day I fucked that day no we're both sitting on the

"no_what i eat in a day & a whole bunch of chatting (vlog) l olivia jade.txt"	"hey guys I got home from Santa Barbara today we're making cauliflower pizza got from Trader Joe's we're junghwa yeah and put chicken pesto on one we're going to probably do pepperoni on the other right or just cheese no that is not pepperoni I agree that was really good like I seriously recommended that it is kinetic head I actually I'm like the pickiest eater in the world I hate all vegetables I hate everything and I couldn't tell that it was our except the texture thoughts concerns questions yeah sounds will be gone I told you your new click wait okay they're doing they supposed to be on the top oh no no Bella wait is that why does this look still gross on camera guys in my particular hat so pieces and cauliflower based foods Patricia teas roses I know I'm in a farce all right let's cut this why does it look like I'm Ana Paula chert I'm in a movie so I just got back from a workout class and I'm going to make breakfast and you guys always ask me to do like what I eat in a day type of video but since I'm vlogging I just thought I could show you like what I eat in a day vlog style I guess I don't know I'm usually for breakfast I scrambled eggs because it's really really good for you before I worked out I had a banana because I can't work out with having like without having something in my body like a little bit of food so I usually have a banana before I work out okay yeah this is my Becca I just got out of the shower and I'm just throwing this little summer dress is literally like degrees out maybe hotter so this little dress is actually from Lulu's but it's like the brand is Billabong and it's really cute and I go on I wasn't going to wash my hair because obviously there's just dry but it's just like I felt so gross since I worked out but I wanted to like style it since I wanted to film but I couldn't because I like we really couldn't stand it it just felt so gross like you know what I mean um but I'm pretty much Peter oh I just stepped on it I think I'm going to upload the what's in my purse video right now I make a little bit hesitant to do so because let me tell the vlog so even though this video will be up after obviously terms I'm uploading this one right now but the reason I'm a little bit hesitant to upload it is because not that I have a nice person it because my purse as you guys know if you watched it was a Gucci bag and I not that I have anything weird in my purse that I wouldn't want people to see just because I kept it really realistic didn't really take anything out of it but um the reason I don't want to upload it it's because I watch that over and I feel like I sound just really vain in it if that makes any sense like I just found I don't know I think a lot of people have been telling me lately like all my videos and I should never let like comments or hate comments get to me but that I'm like not as humble as they used to be and I'm more vain and whatever and I think it just stems because I feel more confident in my channel so I can just be myself more and not like so shy and like ready to please everyone I'm just more myself but I don't want people to think I'm vain because I'm not vain I know I'm not me and I know I'm I try to be humble I don't think I'm the shit so I don't know this video just I feel like makes me seem Thayne I think I'm looking into it a lot because that's what I get in the comments a lot but I hope no one at least I don't care about the haters that think I'm vain but if my subscribers started to think I'm vain that's an issue so I love you guys so much I'm always so grateful for you I'd never want any like anything to come off that way I I'm so humbled to do what I do and I'm so blessed and lucky that over 800,000 people like want to come on this journey with me so I really hope I make that clear and if I don't then it's just my seventeen year old self getting to my head seriously but I think I'm going to upload it so let's do it um you might have seen in my Instagram story yesterday if you guys don't follow me on Instagram it's always link down below but I'll have my socials like right here because I post so much and I update you guys and it's like the best place to follow me if you just want like daily updates but I got a bunch of stuff from fresh so this was not sent to me I bought this with my own money so I was thinking about doing a skincare haul I've never I used some of the products but I've never used all of them I bought a lot of new things and I kind of wanted to switch up my skincare even though I'm a professional answer but I'm out of the products and I know I just wanted to try something new and but I'll probably buy more because you guys know that's like my rideordie skincare um but yeah so I think I'm going to film a haul on this my hair is still a little damp and I need to dry it and then maybe style it a little bit before film I actually want to head downstairs though and make myself a little snack before I start filming and doing my hair and stuff just because it helps with energy obviously it when I'm filming and you hear when I walk my ankle crack I'll write it and normally just press it up now we take it upstairs actually I'm allowed to eat in my room but I hope my parents don't watch us what if they do watch this the reason I in my room I don't think a met and because when I'm in the kitchen and I eat I rush eat because I want to get back to my room and then I make myself whole and I feel sick and I and I binge eat also when I'm in my kitchen like I don't stop eating if I'm just found excit so fast I still think I'm hungry when I bring my snack up to my room I just sit down i watch videos I enjoy myself and I don't feel like I need to rush anything because I'm just content in my bed so that's a trick that's my little trick for me if you binge eat like me I actually Benji I'm not just like claiming like I will eat and won't stop so it's a really good way it's how I lost a lot of weight by doing this actually I mean I lost most of my weight from eating healthy and working out but good check excuse assistant notice my dog is eating her lunch but usually for lunch I like to make myself something not super heavy especially from going out after this because I hate feeling like overly sold so I usually make myself like a little turkey wrap it's one of my favorite snacks it's so yummy and just easy innit not that I don't really I'm not the type of person what I'm eating healthy or like trying to stay fit to count calories I just like put healthy food to my body and eat until I'm full which i think is important I think once you start counting calories you go a little bit nuts but I know that this is pretty low calorie so I usually like having some corn tortillas I prefer corn over flour but if you prefer flour that's totally high if you just do like two of another little and then I'll just keep them in the microwave for like 30 seconds and then I just get like some sliced turkey from the market I just go to that like the deli section then I just have them really thinly like I think it's called oven Boar's Head oven gold is the type of Turkey I got and I just have them slice it super super thin so 30 seconds I just have them slice it really thin and then I just put some of that in the tortilla and I have rock for lunch and it's so good it doesn't make me super full but I usually have like fruit or something else with it so I'm trying to figure out what I might have like chip I don't know whoopee so I look like I'm eating like a fiveyearold and basically I just have turkey wraps and then like some veggie chips and these little cheesy popcorn things from Trader Joe's they're a little bit better than Pirate's Booty I think they're the same thing but try to treat yourself okay and I'm 17 I have to live a little bit so that's my lunch I know I'm 5 don't touch me I genuinely have no idea if my camera's in focus I'm really hoping it is I'm just what you're shopping with my sister so I'm just misty Curzon they said they were just getting salad really quickly like 45 years ago Justin's waiting at home I haven't filmed the video that I was wanting to film today time honestly kind of slipped away but okay I posted today and I'll probably film it tomorrow um no big deal just putting my sneakers on I'll show you guys a little outfit shot the genes of the Redhawks florette open on the screen right here just store and then Kiev and I actually welcome to a show because they were different to me but I like 101 both of them and then this little cross shirt is from Zara it doesn't come across I really took this into my kitchen and cut it and then I'm wearing my little Gucci speakers and these speakers are my favorite because they have this little thing on them and I got future Christmas and then this size red and that size blue and then yeah so but basically the look I'll go hungry I'm eating Massimo cheese you can get the double foods I think or on Amazon like food whatever it is they're so good update I'm snacking on TV it's been like two seconds since I last saw you but they're so good with my outfit if anyone is wondering I can't turn it off options that's from those pirate puffs we made our dad oatmeal raisin cookies because they're his favorite in tomorrow's Father's Day so we're just waiting for them to cook a little bit longer I think they're just about done maybe like 30 more seconds but they look so good oh those look so good I'm probably making everybody watching this want cookies right now because any time I watch the youtuber put food in their vlog or if they're eating or something I always want the food but they look really good they're still like super soft we just took them out a little bit early since tomorrow is Father's Day I completely forgot to end the vlog of course basically after we bake those cookies we just what happened I don't even know we just kind of had a chill night and then obviously yesterday was Father's Day we went to Orange County I saw my grandparents at my cousin's my aunt's and stuff and now I'm back home it's Monday June 19th I'm going to upload this today but I just wanted to give like a some sort of outro since I totally forgot to end the vlog and I also just wanted to say like I'm sorry since this was such like a weird random chatty bug I kind of just liked how casual it was that was like a fun way to catch up with you guys to give you guys a little week speak into my life mal is coming over today so I'm probably going to start a new vlog because we go to VidCon on Wednesday and I definitely want to vlog that and I definitely want to vlog when she's here before so I'm going to end this one now and then basically start another one but down in the description box I am going to have all my VidCon times and panels or if I'm doing Meetup I don't really know my schedule I think I'm doing one panel maybe two I think one so I'm going to link it down or just write it down below if you guys are at VidCon it would mean so much to me if you went to my panel and said hey I want to meet you guys so badly I love meeting you so yeah thanks for watching this vlog and hopefully I will see you at VidCon but if not I'll see you in my next video bye"	2446
"no_WHAT IS A CRONUT.txt"	"good morning everybody time is 9:30 in the morning but it's actually not in actually 2:30 in the morning I'm jetlagged I've got back from LA like a day and a half ago so I woke up for my alarm went off and honestly I can't even tell you how tired I am I had a shot of coffee before I left and I supposed to get the coffee on an empty stomach makes me feel really anxious and I didn't get to see anything because then running late so anyway I'm at a thing I don't really know what it is a thing there's a you know building behind me basically for most things I've done a million times before but it was a really good one so often people invite me to go on stage because I live in London these things happen in London you're on stage and talk about the industry I find myself in so being an influencer oh by the way I hate the word into the words because it I think it implies that I'm Machiavellian and using my influence for no good which obviously I'm not I just want to talk to you guys myself anyway so Lily pebbles she behind me somewhere I think no she's gone she was behind somewhere so me and her going on stage with a couple of people who work for this company and then a whole audience of people who are interested in this industry so you work for brand people just interested in you know what we do I suppose generally and but yeah I'm going to go on there now I'm hoping I'm gonna wake up a little bit before I go on stage as envoys I'm going to just look what what's going on and also I might try and get snack because I do feel a bit jittery other get anxious it's a little bit kind of um worried when I have caffeine on and I always get it and I always think of food but you know how to what dude yeah anyway YouTube Java as fashion blogger we have clinic level and the food challenges I think at the moment so when I first like this job like seven years ago there were three people in were able to really think so although the market immunity is tiny and platforms tiny I was the best of a bad bunch now anyone can make content you know we need a camera and access the Internet and later on when I got margins my words are small with growing and people were consuming but not actually creating out what you made and as I started to grow they told me do fun things like a free tshirt or a trip to London or whatever it was and something looks a lot less interesting I could eat this guy so they'd end up in content as a result now I had a head start a bit of time I started ultimately doing it but I think now more and more and more and more people are creating content because it is quite easy to do that not everyone has success that I've been lucky enough to have a Texas own personality to get somewhere but it so saturates and how that is really important for people who ought to work and influencers and to pick the right person and I actually think people about the longest and partnerships for me I it must be spoke about something I'm really invested in rather than I can oneoff jobs you know what another thing today which is you know I don't deserve any more I'm not being a professional in that out I only work around that I concede potential to compete on a growth and something that I can reward ones I think one was the main issue as seventeen into my person and they cook them Sonny and I got a Jesus I'm a little bit of me on stage with the big Lily pebbles here hi mate how you doing good we're getting a car now and I think it went well I think the jet lag brain kind of keep seeing John poignant I kind of I think I repeat my time yes I always like those things it's interesting to give people who don't understand what we do a real insight from like the horse's mouth works and that's good what do you think LP yeah I feel like I can just talk about it I we did kind of have like Pennock didn't there are two other people on stage with us and some of the questions isn't from the audience but I reckon just me and Lily and we got so carried away a little bit we're going you know I would say to me yeah and this and I'll go yeah and this and then yeah you look good though and I feel like we made it may be

a sheep eieio with a neigh neigh hey Leigh Hearon any Deveny everywhere else name a guy so um she's just gone in the shop to take my Mac bookings for repairing basically because planning to save some a lot of things on then in Sean Maher we can but anyway gesture to see have finally uploaded her second vid on youtube the first one was the Q&A i did with her just to help her get side she's finally done a second video and it's another Q&A but this time is with a husband penny and anyway start talking about it sama phobia and white privilege in the video and i just thought i'd comment on it because it's something that music is spoken on I don't know a shot member how many times or how briefly or how not briefly before but something that we as a family talk about that because there's a lot of people not understanding in the comments and they're all why people get offended by being told that they have white privilege which is really stupid how long since backs it because it's not an offense it's not a label it's about why producing it is it's a thing it's a fact it's a factual thing it's a thing that happens in society it's a thing it's not like if I say you've got white privilege oh I have white privilege because I do because I'm halfway it's not like a personal thing it's not it's not an offensive thing to say it's a thing it's just like think there's racism in this world it's a fact that that's something that happens you know to see and Perry are talking about how you know Perry has white privilege you know he can walk out the door and be seen as a normal person normal white man he doesn't mention well because that society's society sees white as normal this is what white privileges which is what I want to get you suppose racking my brains trying to figure out how to explain this to people because it's literally some people take it personally because it's not to do with poverty not to say that why people don't go through struggle is to say that the white race is seen as the norm whereas every other race is not seen as the norm to get me that's the privilege and obviously with being seen as normal and comes many many benefits that they will never ever see or realize unless they can change their age which we can't or unless they look visibly like for example me to see because we wear scars we look visibly different and what I was the want to say it means you see a half white half Egyptian quite clearly we have light skin we have my skin color but we look different because we wear scarf doing that that obviously we get seen as seen differently but we also have privileges white privilege is compared to let's say a black Chevy to get me privileges for being white within artists and communities within lots and lots of different things as well so it's not just like a the cookie she's in a scarf do she also has privileges but they'll be different there'll be you know there'll be everybody have different depends on your context and everything but for example to see is a lightskinned me and TCR lightskinned hijab you girls will also have white I can imagine if I was a lot darker I would experience I would experience life slightly differently I was reading to the comments and somebody somebody did a really nice short straighttothepoint comment explaining what it is for the people who don't understand I thought I'd read out because actually that's why I'm just the one to say but they said it great and this is from something called internet for an internet freak and then the term white privilege is basically not being seen as different it's not a way of saying white people don't suffer through life or so or suffer poverty etc it's simply saying that you are not seen as someone different every race that's not white is always labeled white race is never a label it's considered the norm you are privileged for that means that we're talking about even in the Asian community if there's a lightskinned girl like skin Asian girl compared to a darkskinned asian girl not it's not just asian community even the Arab Beauty freaking everywhere man black communities if you're lightskinned in any other race you are seen as more beautiful and some people get confused and be like well that's not white privilege that's just like a cultural gobbler is white privilege because whites and being white is seen as the norm and a student seen as beautiful and so other cultures and races want that so it's white privilege because the girl who looks more white gets treated bare to get me I just wish they would just wouldn't go over the head I wouldn't go through it and that's all white people who don't understand what white privilege is and not just white people that also to all people just people who don't understand it because even if you're Asian but you are fair and you are light skin you have privileges within your community you even have privileges out and about because you look more familiar to the norm you get me society sees you in a better light thank you is that better than they would for a person who was in the same say a person who had the same status had the same amount of money you have had the same current life cetera but they were a person of color you would have it better I love my white homies I love white people I love my white yeah I'm your right eye I love you alright I'm not a why here

"no_WHY AM I SCARED  DAY IN THE LIFE VLOG.txt"	"five liters reapply where we go in now the midwife's come in here she's coming to see you or baby brother uh I really looked like he was doing know Chief Keith game did it not yeah directly if Chris is a larger hydrogen babababa Coco Pops that dirty another works now doing a different horse um hi there's another sound good morning guys in certain part time we've got literally every appliance on my tower a tumble dryers dishwasher every day and which is a very simple but we have the Midwife coming today I think she's coming this afternoon as of this morning so then I'm just in that kind of panicky state where I'm cleaning everywhere and just you know making it with it right I think I am quite a clean person but when Midwife is coming to solve a sexual house not it's just I'm really orange now though she's accenting like the cleanliness I don't think that when a midwife is coming to check your house you want to look as nice as possible so I'm just like running around like a crazy person trying anything what did you Mike sorry char box no jump to that one see oh wow this is such a cozy pillow Wow yeah oh yeah you're very good oh do it again all right oh let's not do it to mummies if we do it to mummy the baby might pop out mine it oh and that'd be very silly wouldn't it oh we don't want the baby to pop out just quite yet whopper entire drawer is right and on the level both our launch today had been a bit help because we know we're having a curry later so I want to show you what we're having so I've got some mushrooms tomatoes to bring onion salad turmeric salt and pepper for seasoning and here's some chicken up where you've got pretty cooked in the fruit sorry from the fridge it's a lunchtime and Archie's finished his log with Nana grounded around now and so they're spoiling in with kinder eggs and toys and all skin sort things I just like to show you what happens to my lunch a bit for in fact it's not like I've been loving at the moment so it's toasted bread or well tow flush out this is some toasted bread with some fresh mint very sounds more posh basically it tastes mashed up avocado and tomato I usually like sundried tomatoes but these on and then vinaigrette glaze I mean pat pat bought you a kinder egg you're not going to share it oh I can take the picture can I can I have a little bit of chocolate please I'll get the toy Wow but could I have some chocolate oh thank you M so generous Thank You Archie so I'm just sitting down to do a little bit of work that I need to get back to and Brad went under today and the Midwife is still not being I think she's coming soon to twenty two and four and it's halfpast two now so and I don't know where that's gonna be I hopefully it's not too much later because they've really been able to do anything today but luckily it's a really horrible miserable day so there's not that much we could have done anyway yeah I'm just going to get on with some work on top of them I'm gonna say yeah oh my god if you could take one bad no object oh my I could be your bum yet manage consume about your sister as well oh oh I'm sucking you through now Marly stay here hi guys so midwife just been well a little while ago anyway and then yeah I don't know I feel really weird it all went really well and everything and nothing was said that worried me it's all about having the home birth but I think it's just because it all starts to feel really real now and the fact that you know they say you know the baby could come anytime and stuff it was obvious I know that but I just feel really emotional about it all like us just crying him to Rick and disown like I don't want to I don't want to do it which is so stupid I think the problem is that I feel like no matter what I do something might go wrong which it obviously could happen to anyone during labor I feel like it's all up to me and it's my decision to making if I make the wrong one then I'll regret it like if I stay at home and have a home bath and something goes wrong and I have to be like rushed to hospital I'll feel like well if you were at the hospital already that wouldn't have happened and you would have had to be rushed off in an ambulance nor that or if something happens to the baby at home and they don't have as much you know medical stuff there to help them as they would if I was in the hospital I would like feel guilty for the rest of my life but then at the same time we hardly made it to the hospital last time and the midwife's you know if she said that most second babies do come quicker in her experience so we might not even make it anyway and if I was calm and relaxed at home maybe that would be the best thing she said for moms are low risk and you know usually having a second or third baby's home birth can actually be safer I don't know I'm getting really worked up and up there because the baby's going to come out this is nothing I can do about her I can't just say I'll just live in there for the rest of your life is fine you know I'll carry you to your 20 I think I just need to get more organized and then I might feel a little bit better I need to pack a hospital bag and the baby bag so all of that out just so I have it just in case and then maybe I'll just feel a bit calmer and try and do I've been doing and take everything as it comes and just deal with it as it happens that's all you can do really yeah sorry for my little moan but so it's listening so it's about her pacifier the Midwife is going Kate was just discussing a few things about what we're going to do or shall say what she's going to do I just popped in on as well to get that climb a day I think interesting don't we have done any cuts I don't know we have weekly it's going to be the most boring blog ever yeah I mean we've been cleaning a lot so hopefully you guys watch cleaner or like to go into acai you've done some work we have done some photos and that's why sometimes your nose plugs because we're like looking after our trade 19 so it's like walk we don't obviously it's easier when we go out for the day but then it's nice to do that homely yeah and I think this one that's going to be the home run hopefully because we have got busy week or a couple of weeks ahead so hopefully it will change and we will be doing some natural mixture yes now we're going to enjoy a quarry party to bed and enough games or football ones you're going to relax them well I to get at every Wednesday Wednesday you like a little snack oh yeah I've probably played the same night the same three times for ten years just on and off and there's still ten years later you still forget forget what day is most of the time so that's just cuz you got baby boy it's not stupid

every little helps I suppose well it's done I love camping so much guys look at our setup pretty much it's just my favorite thing to do camping brilliant it's so much better than staying in a hotel through a lot of you will disagree with that I've stayed in a lot of very fancy hotels there's nothing quite like just having a fire going and cooking some meat or whatever there's beauty in simplicity of camping especially well once you get all your gear organized as well with apparently as some baboons around if we hear noises probably baboons so we've got four more days in Namibia than

"no_WINTER WONDERLAND & NALAS BIRTHDAY.txt"	"good morning everybody it is Monday and another week has begun giggling very autumnal to say I'm sorry I need to stop saying it it's gonna be like this for the next month but it actually is look like all the leaves are falling on the tree from the trees and like the apples are all dropping there the leaves are falling and it's all like wet and very chilly out today which is perfectly fitting because today is the winter wonderland for zoella beauty and solar lifestyle I don't know if I've mentioned this in a vlog yet but last year was the zoella apartment and you guys absolutely loved that vlog we all went oh god I'm vlogging and the builders are looking at me you guys loved that vlog it was so exciting to kind of see everything laid out and it's kind of the perfect opportunity for me to get lots of photos and content surrounding the two new ranges in one of my previous vlogs I kind of briefly touched on a couple of the products from the new zoella Beauty gifting range which is called snow Ella for any of you who didn't know but today you're gonna see a fair amount more I don't know what the winter wonderland looks like it's all being kept very hushhush because they want it to be a surprise and I love surprises so yeah you're gonna see my first reaction I have no idea what its gonna look like all I know is in a dress but let me show you the invites for it because it was so cute so this is the invite people would have received look Hucky come and join us at so Ella's winter wonderland and it's like a bauble that's full of snow like fake snow I really love it anyway that's all I know all I know is this ball ball so I think it's gonna be snowy and grey and wintery and there are a couple of things oh this is gonna be your first look at lifestyle you've not seen any of the lifestyle gifting yet and this is gonna be your first look at it that's exciting I've just realized I haven't even given you a sneak peak of lifestyle yet so this is gonna be the vlog where you see lifestyle for the first time it's gonna throw this out there but I do think it is one of my favorite Rangers I say that every time but one of the main things I try and do every time I release products is make it better than the range before which does make it harder and harder every time I've been ready for quite a long time so I've just been sat doing some emails and I also just got a delivery and I wanted to show it to you because it's very fitting with this video I ordered these from Matalin they are Santa Paws pet socks I mean how cute they were three pounds and they will fit on Nana's little feet they're so cute I mean I don't know whether she's gonna absolutely hate wearing these but we'll soon find out hey Poochie yes we will do you like them they're for your feet she's not sure then I got these where are these for Matalin or next I think these were from Matalin they are all you're more interested in those merry and bright indoor and outdoor 40 LED berry lights oh my god I kind of hate how they spell berry that's nice bow berry is it these are colored lights now I don't normally do colored lights but at Christmas I feel like you can get away with colored lights and the reason that I picked these up it's not actually these colors the reason I picked these up is because they have that really lovely retro pink color in them and those are very hard to come by and they're plug in screw battery lights I hate them because I always forget to turn them off and I just end up having to put new batteries in like every single time so we got those from next I got these I absolutely love festive pajamas and this time of year is kind of more your autumnal pajama next do the softest PJ's ever I would highly recommend checking next out if you want to get some PJ's so these were 25 pounds and I think it's longsleeved yeah so you'll be so cozy and then trousers but how cute is that it has a little like sleepy Hedgehog and Badgers and rabbits and a squirrel in a dressing gown with a cup of tea and from Madeline I also got a Christmas tea towel it's very cheesy but it was the green pompoms that sold it to me what else I think this is a candle but I don't have any scissors to open this I did it so this is from next and it's the pomegranate and black lily fragrance candle I just really liked the packaging of this oh it smells very Christmassy that smells lovely what do you think Nullah do you like the smell smell it it's at nice just because one pair of autumn a pyjamas is not enough I also pick these up for Madeline these have little owls and foxes and these were 10 pounds so they were actually quite the bargain and then I got these joggers from next oh my god they are so soft I can't even explain to you how soft these are when I did Alfie's advent calendar that time the men's joggers are this soft and I was really jealous because I didn't pick any up so this year I've got some how much were these are these were 15 pounds okay so there we go that was my little mini haul we are heading out in 15 minutes we are going to go drop this one off at Nick and Amanda's and Nick is

there's something in the handbag maybe zippers got a no treat for them in our bags for tomorrow and it's like it's like they know it's in there no they were not just sitting there honestly and they were jumping I think so yeah look but you can see where it's been slime yeah you should put that on your face as a face mask hello and welcome to Tuesday we have had we being me and my mum have had the busiest day tidying and sorting and just getting everything done that I needed to get done that was stressing me the hell out I am starting this day at around o'clock well I teeth look really white in this light yeah when you just feel like everything is out of its place and you've got a thousand million things to do I felt like that and it was starting to get a little bit much so mum was like Oh coming out for you and I was like oh my god thank God so we've been doing all of that tying all the loose ends tidying sorting everything out before we go away on holiday um hello Nana you tell them what day it is it is knowledge birthday your three today you don't even know your three oh my god I need to find these I think I showed them out earlier okay so me and mum Pat these are Nala earlier they're like these little Christmas dog socks not needed at all and we put them on Nala and I've never seen anything so funny in all my life like she just couldn't walk it was so funny we should try these on her again and see if she's like forgotten what it feels like she got used to them but it was so funny she was walking like Bambi on ice it was so cute oh just a little burp it was so cute I've also made pupcakes which I've done for them every year on their birthdays so it has become a tradition sorry about the loud oh I can't turn it down there let me get down in here I've made them cupcakes but I need to put the cream cheese frosting on the top so that is what I'm gonna do now kid I've already made them look there's always so many and I was gonna invite like all their doggie friends round so Teddy Martha Winnie we were going to invite Carly on and their dog Steven but we just didn't get round to it so next year guys if you're watching next year let's do it dog birthday cuz it would be so much fun they still get their birthday cakes which is good I just need to know ice them so I'm gonna put you down what you was likely find if you will this pup cake recipe it's on my bill I was literally through shafted to another winner doctor are you Egypt well that won't eat any more you got all the chopper that live another day long like dogs do you like that cream cheese that's really good I'm gonna do one like this just like around what do you think Missy what do you think no like like spring this is like the ultimate TVs not us just sitting down there like are you joking me drop here are the finished pupcakes covered in treats and cream cheese with some with a little bit of peanut butter but I've discovered that numbers of really like peanut butter anymore which is a bit weird so there are also some without these are the presents we've got them because they've got very small mouths we can't really get anything too hard or too big so I thought this would be perfect if she loves crinkly things and it's the right size I also got this from the cat section because they're essentially cats in dogs bodies and it is a crinkle snake teaser which you absolutely love it's got no catnip in it as well I have to make sure then a little card and then for buzz this is from Nala obviously then for buzz we got this soft like crinkly toy because he loves things like this I also got him an old man flat cap like I can't wait to see him in this and again from the cat section because our dogs are essentially cats I bought this so that we can tease them with the fish on the stick and I know that they will love it haven't wrapped them do you think it matters that we've not wrapped them the presents I mean our dogs can't unwrap so that part of it doesn't really matter I know a lot of dogs unwrap their own presence but our dogs can't do that so there's no point wrapping them up because we just end up unwrapping them for them so there we go it's buzzing hum in are you gonna see buzzy and poppy and Shaunie all right guys wait a minute look at this oh she's gonna training everything off of it okay buzzy no she weren't your toy oh look white boy Ebers good luck putting that on him it's gonna be really hard he just doesn't like know it might be too big then you can you can put the ears out and we tie it underneath like a card anymore and it's good there's a cherry attached I'll help you out babe I'll flip it over let's take the sellotape our who doesn't like she doesn't appreciate the cars gay bag that tree amazing yeah it's crinkly old feels here cutting hair by the way Phil's joined the dog party yeah I liked this finale dogs have had their birthday cake Kevin years and now it's time for us to sit down and watch the first episode of the second series of dr. Foster dr. Foster was amazing I think I mentioned it in one of my favorites like when did it come up two years ago two years ago oh that was a big but did you hear oh um so it came out two years ago I think I put it in my favorites two years ago because I loved it that much and it's back for series 2 so if any of you haven't watched series 1 is only episodes or episodes and it's really really really good so go and watch the first series and then start watching the second series because you will love it so who are waiting for Alfie poppy and Nick we're gonna play press play I came in here they come you ready ready ready"	3387

"yes _A Day In The Life Sunday With Mark  AD  The Anna Edit.txt"	"hi everyone and welcome back to a new vlog it is Sunday I never normally vlog on a Sunday but I promise we do have some exciting things to do today it's not just cleaning that is luckily out of the way which I'm so happy about but today we are going on a little bit of a road trip so I thought I would take you along for the ride and I've actually partnered up with Bourjois on this video to talk about lipsticks a minute that sweater weather comes back and awesome rolls around I'm back into wearing lipstick these are some seriously long lasting lipsticks they are bold they are matte but they look and feel very comfortable on the lips as well so I'm going to introduce you to all of the shades there are 12 shades and total they range from like red to nude plums pinks corals everything is in there let's do a quick little zoom in so these are the Bourjois Rouge velvet the lipsticks this is the whole line up there are twelve shades in total and obviously you've got your kind of everyday nudes here these are the ones I'm going to gravitate towards more kind of daily and then your more sort of ready perfectly pinks at the end much more of an evening lit for me I want to show you what they look like inside as well because they've got a very high precision little it's like expert application you don't need a lip line or anything with these look at that it's kind of like a overly egg shape so really hugs the lit that really works well with the deeper shade I just think there's a great range of colors here there's something for everyone and it's so nice that they're like bold and Mountain lips but they're not too drying and I just think they wear really well as well like super long lasting up to hours that's what you can get out of these so I don't know what color to go for it and whether to go for more of like a nude this is zero to sort of more of a moves there e3 or to go all out with the red 4: I think I'm going to go to zero two that is the one that seems to me the most so let's get close make sure I haven't got any cookie around my face still yep I had a cookie for breakfast because it's Sunday that goes on so easy I really love that color I think it's a very good everyday color for me and it goes on very smooth very easy to apply I love how it kind of dries down on it's looking even more map now and I love the color even more so our plans for the day let me tell you what we're getting up to we've always wanted to go to Rye it's still technically in East Sussex so it's still technically a neighbor of Brighton but it's about an hour and a half down the coast and we've always wanted to go no you know what let's go on a little adventure today there are Lowe's pubs it's a really good burger place apparently so just gonna kind of wandered around there I think this and cute galleries and shops as well as it's just a nice little kind of seaside town to walk around you ready let's go change of plan we were in traffic jam and then a guy like Wanda and his window and he was like don't go this way basically on like a single carriage ride he was like you can't get past three costs mash it up say time around so everyone has time around I hope everybody is okay but we fell like maybe it's not best to go to ride because there it's kind of like a one Road in one Road out coat place and if we can't get through it's going to take us so long to go like the long way around mark I think is about to pass out he's really hungry and he just wants a Sunday lunch so it's currently about half 12:00 I think we're going to go to our second choice which is a place called lupus but actually I've kind of been meaning to show you in the vlogs anyway because it's quite place to write and like how long does it take us to get there like 20 minutes but 20 minutes from Brighton and it's a really key place to go for a day trip if you're from Brighton or you live nearby or you fancy something a bit different we love a bit of Lewis there's a really good high street as good when I teach shops there great places to eat completely go thro great places to eat and as Mark did mention there is a very good boutique there as well which I took an Instagram off last time I was there and basically wanted to buy the whole shop so this is our plan B we hope everybody is okay Louis so and like hey really one Sunday right there light be fixed no you haven't fixed well I think you can't come in my suggest fine well wait wait it's cool you said no it's not a case of that it's a case of you haven't got enough food so no you can't so now we're walking to nothing we're gonna be so happy when we finally eat I can't wait so chances of us walking to this place and getting a table I'm not I'm not feeling very optimistic but there's that coke brother if we need to there's options we have options yeah yeah we just have to wait a long time and they said about 20 minutes then we can order that's all right I guess minutes of threes in the manganese nation we're really picking out and right thing that was really good yeah Marcus yes demolishing my left quick lipstick updating it because I ain't burger and chips then I think it's doing quite well I like it it's nice and easy so kinda em pasty it's like almost three hours later that was so good shakey camera whirs now we're gonna take you for a little tour of our favorite spots in Lewis or as Mark used to call it there are the cutest little book shops but unfortunately it is Sunday so they are all closed however there's an amazing part for the high street is a good spot with lots of little cute like shops and highway shops book shops all that kind of stuff and we're gonna take you to one of our favorite shops so I think is called the goods store the basics mean it is such a cute little shop I see if we can film in there cuz everything is adorable and I need it adorable I pull a little bottle for my beauty blender and jewelry I will show you when I get home and then a little keychain a third girl book which mark like really no not really but it was really cute a knife there are lovely couple in there if you're in Lewis go in if you walk all the way to the end of the high street there is a very cute fridge with a nice little view out what River is it you should know that I should I never can never and which one it is news of ADA by now the feeling is the teeth that you want that new people they go yes local knowledge I thought before we head back I would quickly show you what I got from goods store I got myself this little girl boss um keyring and it says it's made by key tags by various projects super cute I'm just a sucker for anything with a slogan on and then I got this bowl as well it's bit hard to do emptyhanded it's like a 70s ceramic bowl I thought it'd be really good for my beauty blender and like jewelry and a lot of things like that good purchases I think I do too and the weather is really brightened up it's lovely right now I'm about to step off because I'm boiling I've got to do an outfit today so I thought I was showing you now this is the Demi lis like massive Chungking it like fishermen JumpStart thing that I got in New York I showed in my New York haul video with Lily that went up on Sunday thank you for all of your lovely comments on that it's obviously some day today so I'm seeing them all out and I'm so glad you enjoyed with it and I love doing the chatty get ready with me with Lily like we should definitely do that more often so that was such a lovely cool relaxed video to film and I was back to Lily's video this morning it was it was cracking me out very good time doing that and then these are the the top shop motto row hem straight leg jeans that my new favorite like style of jeans a lot of they're straight leg I like that they've got like a ripped hem at the bottom they're nice and highwaisted I get them in a 28 32 and they're like kind of the perfect fits me they're not too tight but not too baggy then I've got on these my whistles they were from last year and they're literally my favorite boots of all time because the leopard print they're Chelsea boots they've got pointy toes they went out of stock very quickly last year but I checked on the whistles website the other day and they're back they're not exactly the same I think they have a zip instead of this stretchy bit of elastic but they look very very similar so I'll make sure their link down below for you and then my little Selene tree over because if it's everything in but I will make sure that everything is linked down below for you in case you bill spending is almost five o'clock so I am getting out of these clothes now I get it something a little bit more comfy cuz I just kind of Warner I thought might read a book on the sofa it sounds kind of good but it's still gonna keep face to makeup on still testing this out let's see how it goes because mark and I we didn't have dessert in that place in the end because they were just being a bit slow and we were like we need to go see everything before everything closes but I did say to mark we can go to the supermarket and pick up a dessert on the way home and we did and its massive it's like a four person five sticky toffee pudding because through him that big good old test for the lipstick later on I'd love to say that it was like 9 o'clock or something but I'm not gonna lie it's seven o'clock I'm ready to have a bath and get into bed I've been editing the vlog and I just showed my hot the bit where he does like the little kick up but I perfectly timed that I know it's like the perfect shot like a fun day we planned it it's my favorite part of the vlog I love that bit and bye hope you've enjoyed this vlog quick lipstick update before I sign off for the day and take my face off I'd say it's still looking pretty good what you think what's that mullet Oh looking good I think it's worn off slightly but it's worn off very evenly and I love the color and I have like to say about these lipsticks actually I'm really gutted I didn't wear a bold lip today because I think that really would have shown how longlasting they are and also I think the fact that they go on so sorry but you don't listen honestly really this would be really boring for you okay I think the formula works really well especially for the more bold shades because you know you've got a matte lipstick and you're putting it on and it kind of tugs at lips because it the formula is so dry and chalky and you want that matte finish but actually applying it as a real pain and sometimes you might have to use a liner or lip brush to kind of smooth it on and get it that little like slippy texture almost this has that texture naturally on application and then drive down matte so honestly is going to be so good for the deeper shade and awesome over autumn and winter and I'm sure you're gonna see me using them again in a video so thank you so much to voice your for sponsoring this video it's always so nice apartment Brown I love and use I've always thought that their lipsticks and their foundations have been completely spoton but I will see you on Sunday the brandnew video that's gonna be oh my lord some capsule wardrobe pull I've shown you a couple of things especially in this video so I saw a couple more things but yeah I bought a very awesome coat and I can't wait to share that with you so I will see you then thanks for watching bye"	2429

Omar insisted on cooking some potato wedges as well which don't go with my idea but there we go but I suppose it needed some substance and then we're having what's it called I'm even reading the label mozzarella as well doing my work in bed in all honesty and I quite often end up doing my work in bed I feel like my brain is still functioning quite well but my body just isn't so it's quite nice to get my feet up and I find that I can sort of concentrate quite well it is now called past 10:00 about an hour or so of work to do I really want to read some of my book that I'm reading at the moment that's very good but I don't know where they'll have chance tea and then I will no doubt wash my face brush my teeth and go to sleep so thanks for watching this everybody and if you want more information on the brilliant and free Pampers rewards at pampers club app then check the description box below ditto if you want to see my pregnancy announcement video on the uphill Channel make sure you go and subscribe to that new channel and I hope you've enjoyed this as I said before I'm going to try and do a work day one that sort of mirrors this so look out for that and yeah I shall see you next time"	1692
"yes_A DAY IN NEW YORK  Lily Pebbles.txt"	"hi everyone welcome back to my Wednesday vlog today I'm in New York if you follow me on Instagram you would have seen that I'm here but I know this video is going up I think a couple of weeks after hopefullly saw all my photos and stories whilst I was here cuz I'm having such a nice time I'm here with Anna we're staying in the Crosby Street hotel and I've never stayed here before and it's absolutely beautiful it's so homely and lovely I was saying yesterday how I just feel so like happy in this hotel room you know sometimes you just feel like you're a bit homesick I've unpacked I've settled myself in and I literally feel like this room has become my home so I'm very happy here we've actually come out here with Bobby Brown it's a huge global press event so there's other bloggers and youtubers from all over the world so it's a really like huge three day long event and I'm actually working with Bobby Brown for this video which is so exciting you guys know I love Bobby Brown they are launching some new lipsticks a bloody love and new lipstick launch so we got here on Monday night and the trip so far has been so incredible they have absolutely spoilt us like at every opportunity they give us some kind of little gift like when we arrived there was a beautiful cashmere sweater on our bed yesterday we got given this cookbook which has something to do with what we're doing today every time I come back to my room is like something on my bed so they're thoroughly spoiled to us and there was a beautiful event first evening where we made flower crowns and then yesterday we did like a cocktail making masterclass it's been amazing so far but today is like quite a big day so I wanted to just vlog today because we're going to Brooklyn the idea of today is that we're having a little tour of Brooklyn and going to meet quite a few of Bobby Brown's girl crushes and it ties in so well with the lipsticks that I'm gonna tell you about they're called the crushed lip color and they come in shades which is amazing I love when a lipstick launch has like loads of shades in it the idea is that the lipstick is a really nice soft pigment and you can blot it down and give that real like effortless lipstick look which I really love it it's very New York the lipsticks are inspired by their effortless cool and easy beauty routines of Bobby Brown's girl crushes so you know the girl who just like swipes her lipstick on gives a little blot and she just looks ultra cool I feel like I will never be that person so when we came here on the first night the lipsticks were waiting for us on our bed there in this like glass box and it says girl crush lip crush and as I said there are 20 shades they are oh my god look at this this is an actual girls dream very like new like lots of nudes nudie pinks they're definitely like a theme going on here but there are definitely a few like brighter pops of color as well so far my favorites I haven't tried them all yet bear is the most beautiful nude which I think I'm gonna wear today bear is lovely last night I wore plum which is really nice like deep berry slightly like red berry they're very creamy and they they kind of feel moisturized on your lips so they're very easy to wear I am so excited by these lipsticks and I'm really excited for today I'm really into this girl crush theme because it's totally up my street I'm here with Anna who is obviously my number one girl crush also last night at one of the events where we meet will the other girls are the bloggers and stuff

"yes_A Day In The Life Of A Youtuber  Niomi Smart AD.txt"	"hey everyone so just got up and today I'm going to film a day in the life of a youtuber so you guys know what we get up to and we've got pretty nonstop days so this morning I'm going to go on a run and then come back and get some breakfast so when I get my gym stuff I literally have to stand on a stool like this to get it because I keep it all up here because these wardrobes are so high but to be honest I really should just keep it and drawers down here because I probably wear my gym stuff more than any of my other clothes where I'm ready now for my run about to head out door and I think I'm going to aim for about 10k run I tend to go on a run about once or twice a week and usually always in the morning actually just because I feel like it really sets me up the rest of the day gives me loads of energy and it's just so really great to Venice there's just something about going on around in the morning especially now that the weather is a bit nicer ROG I love it so much my run now so it's time for breakfast I've got this homemade granola here some almond milk and then also some berries to go on the top and now it's this time when I just kind of sit down enjoy my breakfast and I go over comments on Instagram and also YouTube videos it's just like the perfect opportunity while I'm eating and drinking so at the moment I'm drinking this naked smoothie this is the blue machine and this is my favorite flavor and I find after a run it just really refreshes me so it's a perfect time to kind of have a bit of a pickmeup and the ingredients are amazing full of blueberries and blackberries and stuff so yes I'm just enjoying that now a lot so now it's about the time when I just catch up on emails I normally have quite a few to get through and also editing writing blog post all of that kind of stuff II try and get the admin stuff done earlier on in the day rather than later so that at least it's just out of the way but at the moment I'm just flicking through a few magazines just to get some inspiration of what to wear for my photo shoot that I've got on later on I've got about four outfits to shoot but I'm just always looking through these kind of fashion editorial picks because I just love all the different kinds of clothes and obviously it keeps me updated with what's on trend and everything so yeah I think I'm going to go now I'm just fine looking my wardrobe and see what what going on what I was thinking was this gorgeous dress here that is brand new and I love the back because it's backless it's just got a lovely bow I'm definitely going to do that but also where is it I've got a really nice shirt somewhere ah here it is is this shirt I really really like that and I just saw a really similar one in an editorial sheet in one of the magazines so I feel like that will look really nice with ripped jeans and then a couple of other outfits as well and I'll figure out the shoes in the bag so this is basically for my blog so every now and again I'll just get a few outfits done in one day so that I've got nice and really nice content like fashion content and my blog or my Instagram kind of thing so this is one thing that I always try and do at the beginning of the day I love writing lists so I create a list of things to do for work and then a list for life and that just really helps me find the balance between work and life and for me being on stop is about aiming high staying positive and powering through and alone nonstop days can be daunting I keep positive and remind myself that at the end of the day is flattered I love not knowing what tomorrow brings every day is different and that's what motivates me and now it has been a time I'm going to be making it somewhat delicious food from my boat eat smart and I'm going to take a few photos make Instagram and interest stories that kind of thing and then I've got a friend coming round later to enjoy it and here we go these are my Cabana mummys little little sticks here and one tip that I always do when I make these it's always in the summer by the way and if you rinse season water or even best if you soak them for like half an hour and water it prevents them from burning I'm not promising that they're not going to burn at all but I'm just saying it will definitely help so these are going in the oven now there are about minutes so here it is the finished product this is a bulgur wheat tabbouleh salad and then these are my veggie kebabs with my fetish sauce and I've sprinkled over some coriander as well and there's some fresh lime to squeeze over the top as well so I've taken all the photos that I need for Instagram of those recipes and now I'm just going to set the table my friend should be here soon and we're just going to have a really nice night in so that's my day as a youtuber I must say though and I'm sure every youtuber can agree with me that every day is different and that's why I lost this job so much it's just you never get tired of it you never get bored we get incredible opportunities I'm so grateful for we get to travel everywhere and I truly truly love my job and but what I really love to see what I'm really interested in seeing is what your day looks like when you have a fullon day so if you share your nonstop video moments using the hashtag we are nonstop I'll be able to see that see what your kind of salon day looks like and yeah I'd love that but I really hope you enjoyed watching this video and I'll see you soon bye"	1160

"yes_A FANCY VLOG AT THE CLARIDGE'S WITH SPECSAVERS"	"there you go thank you so what this is really hot tea oh I've got some Queen Earl Grey tea here in my Kylie Minogue mug in my Kylie Minogue glasses anyway just before Christmas Sid and I got to go to the launch event of Kylie Minogue's I wear collection I'm a bit late so we go in Liat did with me is off oh nice hi dude hi so let's go in it was at the Claridge's Hotel it was the first time I'd been there because I'm not much of a posh nosh you see it was very fancy fancy let me just talk about why I wore first of all think of it without that Claridge is I thought let me make a bit of an effort obviously so this is one wearing this is the cloakroom whether we can do this all right oh my decided to wear really nice roughly trousers and in dark navy dress paired with it and I wore this really nice time auntie choker but I got so many compliments for so we went inside went to the cloakroom put our coats away in fact they were separate cloakroom there's one for ladies and one for the Sun the men's nakum's that way though so said byebye when inside had a good old mingle we got to have a look at the full collection which consists of 30 pieces altogether 25 optical glasses and five sunglasses that was the second most fun part of the night please to love and look at these back they're amazing we spent ages trying on almost every single pair that they had there oh that right I ended up trying the pair's I'm wearing now guys I might not me the rest of the event and of the pilot pilot like Eileen actually chose these because you can't disagree they look fabulous on me I'm going to run again but the way that they had the collection displayed was super cool it was almost like honeycomb display with the glasses in each one they were honestly so many glasses that I was absolutely drooling over let's say I decide I neveri want them all but these ones for now I decided to get these at the ends because to me these are classic they suit my face I love it when they're a pair of glasses with a clear frame eliteness these ones in particular are the Kiley 13 glasses these are a champagne acetate if I just come up a little closer you can see that hint of champagne around my eyes I just think I mean listen I could talk all day about how much I love these glasses but instead I'll just wear them with almost every outfit but there were so many glasses that I really wanted to Nick but seeing is where the Claridge's obviously I wasn't going to Nick anything right also it's illegal what I did manage to do is take a selfie with every pair that I like so what out for those pictures on Instagram to date anyway after having a look at the whole collection and meeting new people and trying very interesting canapes we were all led into the main room where we actually got to see the collection in action in a fashion show posted by the one and only Emma Willis can see the preview of the Connie knows I won't mention spectators one aerated practice that will appeal to stylish concert women they wanted a true global fashion icon obviously Kylie know for that person not typically expected as well you can either to a 90 day and six apart in Europe to collect a secret service that is 25 optical and 5 sunglasses and there it looks absolutely enter each occasion and reason to finish supple modern classics and all of the styles have a sense of elegance and femininity here though is quick taster as what you are asking there were three categories that all blinged reinvented vintage and modern classics by far my favorite was the reinventing about that I thought my favorites were the reinvented vintage glasses they were just a hundred percent döner written all over them except they had kindly written all over them because obviously they can't even Oh glasses ha shisha was amazing it was so fun to watch really lively really upbeat the atmosphere was above them then once it was over Kylie Minogue herself came out audience got to chat with her and Emma willand where she talked to us about the collection how she got to designing it her love for glasses and all things frames I'm very very proud of his room his glasses are at the Parkway of their lives and if you could pick anyone who would not be wearing a bucket decide to use because I learn me um it's a Queen of England commencing a victory round if you shorted out 11 amazing time of night I know my my phone is very much looking forward to choosing probably one of everything from the range I'm a Roman citizen any family has verses yes always boy thank you for being with us today I mostly find something that you like on the city walls thank you very much it was so fabulous to see her in real life she's very genuine very downtoearth as he went on the stage when everything was done and had a cheeky photo session there you know whenever you find perfect location guys from Instagram opportunity you must take it so I did obviously Kylie Minogue is a fashion icon actually inspires so many women not just through her music but also through her Styles you've got very very classic look and that really really came across in her glasses even if it wasn't something I might particularly choose there was something very classy about every single pair I also really loved how much of a variety the collection has and I feel like Kylie managed to cater for all women with this collection which is I think something that's actually quite hard to do but Kylie I respect savers managed to do that together pretty well if you asked me a lot of the glasses are also designed specifically for petite faces because Kylie herself is quite petite so obviously she felt that that was something that was much needed we also got to meet the Specsavers team and they were so lovely they really have great van I'm very very accommodating which is always a bonus when you go to these things unit we have some more time mingling I confirmed what glasses I wanted which are these babies over here the candy 13 remember the style for when they launched on the 14th of February then we have to go so on the way out I got a goodie bag mate goodie bag once a dude but what's it gonna do it devices not my kinda dude I thought what I would do is open the goody bags for you guys on camera we actually got to vide bags so I've already

"yes_a mini vlog hair routine, little nyc clips  nycbambi (ad).txt"	"morning guys so I just woke up and brush my teeth and all that but I have to get ready and do my makeup and do some other things because I am meeting up with a friend in West Village for breakfast so I'm going to take you guys with me I have some other stuff to do I think honestly I'm not really sure how today is gonna pan out but I know that you guys really like blogs and I just really wanted to take you with me okay much better I feel like every time I do my makeup I just feel so much better and like I'm ready to conquer the day so I am going to show you how I have been doing my hair recently this week because it's like kind of different and I just I think it's really cool and I just want to show you guys basically I'm getting brunch with a friend I haven't seen in a really long time because she went to Italy for a semester so I've been missing her a lot and I'm so happy that she's back in New York so we're just gonna get brunch um and yeah I just really wanted to do a vlog like this where I kind of you know take you guys with me around the city because I feel like the previous vlogs have been just me doing laundry or me just being really boring okay um but I've never done a vlog like this so I apologize in advance if it's like kinda messy and not as professional as the blogs that you probably see um but I'm going to try and film and just like talk to you guys throughout the day as much as possible because I feel like it's just fun and it'll probably be a lot of clips of me just walking and stuff like that um but I will keep you guys updated and basically just take you throughout my day which should be fun I think I hope but yes okay I'm going to show you how I am doing my hair this morning okay so my hair is obviously looking very weird this morning because I just brushed it um and my hair always has like a natural wave for some reason even though I really don't do anything to it um and sometimes I like wearing it in waves but sometimes I just like where you know what I see like models put it and just like super slick ponytail or just like it's down and straight and then um so I found this and you're probably like what the heck but it is a brush that straightens your hair it's not as damaging as a regular strainer because I really don't like using heat on my hair um especially with a straightener where you have it like clamped between these two hot you know plates and I feel like that's so bad for your hair where as this you know you're not you're just kind of brushing through your hair like you normally would um and it only goes up to 378 which I know is still considered high but compared to like straighteners that will really go up to like 400 and like degrees it's not that bad so it won't damage your hair as much as a normal strainer would because it has bristles it really runs through your hair and makes it less frizzy so this will be eliminated quite soon this is from vanity planet I'm sorry I didn't even say that and I will have a discount code that you guys can use but first let me do this it feels so good it's really just like brushing your hair I'm going to finish treating my hair with this and then I will show you the final results and then we will move on with our day because I need to get dressed and I need to take a subway so you can just it's so straight mmhmm and again I don't do straighter often so I just love the changeup and it still has volume but you can get a promo code that literally gives you 50% off so I will leave that in the description with the link and everything so you guys can check it out if you want to alright guys so I have decided on an outfit um Topshop array which I'm pretty sure I'm going to wear just because of how cold it is but not sure and then vintage this vintage cardigan which is super huge super comfy um and then just this brandy melville shirt underneath it and then Free People jeans and these amazing prices it's which I'm already obsessed with I'm so cute yeah I can show you in the mirror that's easier so yeah and that's not all I'm gonna wear oh I'm going to wear this Zara likes aviator jackets here and again another item I've just been so in love with because it's just such like a staple um yeah so cute so I'm definitely going to wear that because it is literally degrees thing and I'm just going to bring this fry um bag to um I have on these vintage earrings cool let's it out okay so I got cake what did you get in the okay hi guys so I'm actually back home because it was just so cold out like I wanted to do you know other things and everything but it's just so cold it's like my feet were numb so I was like alright taking the subway back home and yes but I want to show you guys a couple of things I wanted to a stop just because um I just wanted to hand cream because my best friend um had a hand cream from them and I was like wow this is amazing and it's actually not that expensive you know compared to their normal products like it's it was only so I was like alright this is good it's a big tube it'll last me so I just decided to go ahead and do it because I love the ESOP in the West Village and the guy was so nice he gave us tea and literally I tried all these different scents hmm this is the one and look how cute this bag is so rosemary leaf hand bomb and it comes in this pretty big tube again so I was like alright it's good and hopefully I can take this traveling with me I'm not sure about the carryon but probably in my luggage for sure I think this might be too big to bring on a plane but it's good because it's winter and my hands have been absolutely terrible so also I'm going to Puerto Rico this Wednesday so excited honestly I probably will already have pictures up and everything by the time this goes up but um so I've been like recruiting tons of beachy things because I haven't had you know obviously any summer things in my closet so I bought this back on Etsy and I just received it today and I really really really want to show you guys how cute is this is is it weird that it kind of smells vintage no that's a good thing alright I think I'm going to need scissors so this is the beach bag I got off of Etsy and so in love with it it looks even better in person and actually I didn't think it would be this big it just has this like basket woven pattern which I think is just so perfect for the beach and then it has like this really vintage vibe obviously with this thing and the whatever this material is on top but yeah so it's vintage I will link the store that I got this phone like the little Etsy shop but I'm so excited to use it now yay not even for the beach I feel like I could probably use this um you know just in the summer as like a summer staple bag so yeah very successful day alright guys so I think I'm going to end this vlog here hopefully it was like entertaining honestly I'm not going to know until I edit but flea you guys found it interesting and it was just a little glimpse into what I do on days when I don't have class and I don't have homework I got all my homework done yesterday and it took me like three hours but I was just so happy to have this day free and do everything because tonight I am going home because it's my mom's birthday so I have to do that and pack and everything but yeah I hope you want me to do more of these because I so would I just really don't think I'm like a good vlogger so I don't know how you guys will feel about this but yeah but thank you so much and I will see you guys soon bye"	1616

"yes_Another Weekly Vlog  AD  Lily Pebbles.txt"	"the last time i've logged I just had my keratin treatment which was yesterday although it was last week for you guys so i thought i'd show you what my hair looks like the morning after having it done normally i wake up and my hair looks like this and it's never stray i always have to straighten it and this is how i've woken up obviously i need to go over the roots a little bit just because you have to keep it straight when you've had a keratin treatment but apart from that it is the straightest it's ever been I've never worked up with hair like this it was a bit of a struggle to sleep my hair down because I hate having like hair on my neck when I'm hot I really wanted to tie up but I can't believe how straight it is this morning oh my god I said I've got cold with a ver out of hay fever pills which is a bit of a disaster I'm just going to do some work today tonight I'm heading out for Louise's book launch and for dinner with Anna and mark so I think I've vlog a bit today if I can we ditched our duvet last night because it was so hot and instead slept with the duvet cover it's so much cooler today like 10 degrees cooler it's amazing it's so nice I miss sitting at my desk and scheduling for the rest of the week and planning or when I'm going to my videos I think we're going to do another day in the life video because that went down really well last time by thing this time I'm going to do a really busy day out so I don't know how that will work but I'm going to try and make it happen because I want to make them different each time that's kind of the whole point every day it's different so hopefully we'll do that kind of schedule in some videos trying to plan ahead because I'm going to LA I think I've told you guys me and Anna going to LA because we're gonna go to VidCon but we're also going out there like a week early to have some fun in LA meet some youtubers that we like and maybe hopefully doing some kind of meetup event thing but i will let you know when it's confirmed because i'm not hundred central yet but we are going to be at VidCon which be fun i've no idea what to expect never been i am excited to go to LA I can hear my washing beat pain and it's ready to go to the dryer wow this is such a riveting vlog isn't it is riveting the web right word exciting who Dixie ok a bit hot which doesn't like the hot she's from Tibet no I think I've ruined my favorite shorts they were all like silky knit come out or hard and crusty I think they were hand wash only damn I hope they're still and sailor I need to buy another pair rich is definitely better washing clothes than I am because he has to wash his like sports stuff and shirts all the time so he normally does it I'm really annoyed I've just ruin those shorts I'm going to try this makeup forever hydrating primer that I bought when I was in needs it's a bit like the laura mercier one but better packaging it feels nice actually on the skin I see how it helps my makeup hold out throughout the day I'm just going to do my makeup now you guys to see me do that a million times before so far back there sec okay makeup done um I've done pretty much same thing with my skin I always do but with the kevyn aucoin candlelight to highlight and I've done like ready brownie eyes that's what I fancied for today and tonight i think i'm going to try and film part of my granola video now i'm not going to do the speaking part because the house is too noisy but i might do cutaways actually like the cooking pot I'm gonna go and see if I can go do that now I absolutely love my new tripod but it's so much heavier than old one so when I was like area downstairs it's like carry a baby I just got like a quarter way through filming my granola video and then I realize I just don't have time to do it today it's already half one I don't know why the way time I need to leave here at like half to I think I haven't eaten yes so I'm just going to unload the future of pain which is all here and then I really need to get dressed and head out I'm going this afternoon to get a blood test done for my whatever it is see if I'm wheat intolerant or gluten intolerant or any of those things if not then my friend Jemma who's a nutritionist is helping me with it and if it all comes back negative she'll just help me figure out what I should be eating why should but it would be interesting it's better to get tests that kind of self diagnose so I'm going to get that done today and then they send it off I think it takes two weeks to come back do you have enough fruit I fools mangoes watermelon nectarine snow peaches pears nectarines avocado lemon line banana think for lunch I'm going to make avocado mango and hair just let all smushed together like a salad etype this is what I'm gonna eat bit random but mango avocado and tomatoes nice light and fresh for a hot day okay I'm finally ready to head out my feet is so swollen I just had to run them under cold water me and my mom have this thing where in the heat or feet just swell up it's really weird and so I'm wearing my blue topshop top the one with the kind of side bits and my Topshop's court which means it looks like a skirt is actually shorts that's not attractive my office sandals which I should not be where I'm with swollen feet because they are going to make them worse and legs covered in mosquito bites that I've tried to cover up using the laura mercier secret camouflage hasn't really worked though I'm going to wear my rayban wayfarers the day and I'm gonna head off for a blood test I haven't really thought about the fighters I'm going for a blood test but it really freaks me out i really hope i don't faint I'm not good with heat and blood and injections and things like that so I'm just going to go and get it done it's not much blood just need to not be a wimp and just do it I think the problem is when they do it I hold my breath and then I get all lightheaded so I'm just going to try and breathe in London when you drive into central London like town if you drive you have to pay congestion charge which i think is like 13 pounds but I really don't want to go on the tube in such a hot day specially we like having a blood test and feeling faint so I'm just gonna have to pay the congestion charge and loads of people say I can't believe you drive is at London or aren't you scared with something I'm completely used to go obviously been doing it my whole life that's a lie I've only been driving since I was 17 but I've been doing it for 10 years so I don't find a scary until I actually find it much scarier driving in country roads where there's like no lights at night where riches from in the middle of the country there's no lights with windy roads d and run out the middle of the road I find that waist area that central London everything's very slow okay I'm out and didn't hurt to didn't even feel thing I just turned my head didn't look she was like your case that was going to be wid but it was finally didn't feel it I've got a little plaster now my arm it's all good i'm gonna head to topshop i think i've got a hour or so there's nothing to do so i'm gonna go see if I can find any nice clothes for their legs I really need some more dresses and places I'm happy with my purchases and everyone looking in thinks I am talking to myself right now maybe they think I'm on loudspeaker yeah I'm going to pretend them just a loud speaker talking to someone anyway only thing I pick up rich from Green Park and then we're both going to go to Louise's book launch Anna remark gonna be there and then we're going out for dinner afterwards because wait how's Anna said she's moving I think Anna's told you guys that she's moving so I'm allowed to say it has to be our last dinner asked for before they move mmhmm I can't talk about it with my friends and moving away and leaving me so selfish making about me I'm gonna go get rich and see you guys in a minute a bit windy Sonny's bit cooler than yesterday except myself chiappa friends have a drink celebrate with Louise and head up dinner right now it's so hot sweaty in there we're going to go find somewhere really knickers I don't log here and I think Alex and Victoria maybe the twins are going to come to dinner with us hopefully everywhere Beatles it would have to go to starboard and they were lucky because daddy you'll be like we tried to get in fucking bird because I've always wanted to go there it's always on my agent shale secrets just a confused specially doing Wimbledon I feel like everyone goes there so I think we're going to try the Big Easy which meant to be like ribs burger for my stuff it's such a nice dinner with everyone such a lovely group of people it was really nice and a bit and frustrated because Jaclyn hill youtuber makeupartist released a collaboration with becca cosmetics you did a highlighter and it was gonna go on this floor website at 5pm today but obviously I was out having my blood test so I set an alarm because I when I thought I was home and I couldn't get it cuz I was oh and I've got this little Anna to buy me one and I've just seen her tweet they sold out but she said they're gonna be back on the website a few hours but it's like half eleven here don't wait up for a few hours so i don't know i really want one I'm so upset it might be installed when we go to LA but I think they'll be sold out I really want one anyway and when I go to bed and I will flog again on Saturday so i'll see you guys then I I just realized I haven't started vlogging but I literally did just wake up and I'm doing my makeup because I'm just filming a few cutaways for the video is going up in a couple of weeks because as I said I'm trying to get ahead for LA so that means working a bit on weekends which is fine because rich is gone out for a workout oh gosh windy and so I'm just quickly gonna film like five cutaways it's quite hot when you do make makeup cutaways and it sounds ridiculous but it's quite hard because you have to like I don't I never do my makeup take off and do it again on the same day feel like it's really bad for my skin so you have to kind of make time enough days to do your makeup i'll try to show like three different foundations and that's like three days of filming can't really explain but it takes up a lot of time doing like the cutaways and showing how the makeup actually looks on my face so I'm just doing those now my camera set up here just in front of my little stool that my bed have made a very neat because I hope that you guys really care what's in the background is more of wars in the video so I'll be back with you in five minutes okay my makeups done but

on weekends more me and rich are going to head out to the supermarket soon because it's gorgeous day so we're going to have a nice barbecue for lunch us Brits always like to have a good barbecue when it's sunny because does it happen that often having some kind of heat wave at the moment I think everyone around the world thinks we're all mental for just talking about the weather all the time but it is being insanely hot like 10 year's record hot so I don't know what we're gonna get I kind of fancy like ribs or something like that I'm wearing these sandals today which I got last year from whistles and I love them the colors so happy and bright we're just going to go pick up some food for lunch you have got much actually because any me rich and my parents who eating's we're just gonna get ribs sausages we've got load salad stuff at home I think my mom's going to make a watermelon and tomato gazpacho which sounds amazing and rich least get shirts as well well we're here okay we're

"yes_ANTIGUA TRAVEL DIARIES  Fashion Mumblr Vlog.txt"	"cheers morning guys welcome to my antigua travel vlogs so as you can see I'm in paradise at the moment we arrived last night and I still can't believe that we are here I feel very very lucky right now during open the blinds at o'clock this morning too this view was pretty surreal had a little bit of jet lag so I actually went to gym at like o'clock this morning and we've just done yoga on the jetty hence the gym outfit so of course we moving you guys along for all the fun today on the agenda we're going to have breakfast now and then we're going to go on a snorkeling trip we're going to use them anew and then just have cameras I'm really excited to play around with so yeah welcome to Antigua hey hello I cannot community I have to bring in them but we are going to be putting that new and done in the past though this is none will try to get maybe fish hopefully so it is a few hours later we had a fabulous time on snorkeling trip even managed to see a stingray which hopefully you might be nonstick out but then we had a fabulous lunch and we've been relaxing in our own little piece of paradise before the afternoon it is now my favorite time of day golden hour I think I'm going to try flying a drone in a bit so that they can the software as you speak so fingers crossed I've got to get some nice aerial shots for you but yeah however come around too much today because I feel like I was totally zenned out feeling very peaceful and kind of forgetting about wellness with apologies that a little bit but we're about to enjoy afternoon tea on the range those things links out here at the Carlisle base which is quite thrill having our community in partner but yeah let's get right okay so I think I got a few drone shots fingers crossed it's quite hard to see out there the lighting on the screen is pretty challenging and as you can see I'm inside now and to make up for not vlogging I'm going to do a little mini get ready with me and hopefully share a few tips on how I like to get ready especially when I've been on the beach all day as you can see my hair is filled with seawater my skin is just super shiny and I've got about an hour's get ready so first of all I'm going to hop in the shower and my hair needs serious nourishment after day and see I've been enough to see all day snorkling and then just now on the beach so I definitely need a hit of moisture recently I have been trying out the coconut milk range from Garnier and it is exactly what my hair is craving when I'm on holiday from that old enough length collection it's got that she derived ingredients but it's especially the macadamia nut oil which just filled my hair with goodness and especially you know what it's like after don't see your hair does need to be filled with goodness again so I'll definitely be using this shampoo and then I'm going to be using this re in one and I know this looks like a pretty big product to bring on holiday even though I'm only here for four days but I find that my hair really needs things like this I have got a lot of hair and it gets very very tangled so I always bring a hammer with me just one into three and why so you can use it not and use a deep conditioner when you're in the shower which is what I'm about to do you can also apply it when your hair actually you know what when your hair is this kind of done when it's just a little bit wet but you just want to add some serious deep condition for the rest of the day that's my first holiday hat you can also apply it to dry hair just on the air smooth any flyaways so I think that I'm going to apply it with the original use of the mask in the shower at the moment and now help me detangle because at the moment yeah we've got some seriously naughty hair going on so even my colour green shower do now I need a shampoo and a normal conditioner and sometimes in my hair is really really bad I need to use a mask straight away but what I'm saving this one for today is my after shower covering treatments of my hair so when I get out the shower especially on the beach holidays I find that I just cannot get a hair brush through my hair despite using an ugly condition in the shower but what makes this mask so special is it is a threeinone so we can do it either apply as a mask in the shower and just leave it on for like five or even ten minutes and then commercial has to afterwards or you can do I like to do and I personally find this the best when your hair is maybe like sixty percent dry like this to take the spoonful or it's good full and then rub it through your hair and and out your hair dries in the joy now and then and your hair dries it really just focusing all those nourishing ingredients and softens the hair makes it shiny and then also if you do when you has a little bit more dry can help get rid of Swire ways as well I might do a second round of this so I mentioned it's paraben free it's got naturally derived extracts and because of those lovely ingredients in here it just smells so so good so now I just associate this smell the holidays it's like a really warming coconut smell and yeah I just love it so as you can see it's making my hair super easy to brush through I'm just using a wet brush like my savior's and as the evening goes on my hair will just absorb all the goodness from this mask alright so now is about all brush through my hair I'm going to start on my makeup so I'm just going to tie my hair in a low bun just to keep it out of the way and then I'll show you a few more Beauty holiday hack right there as I mentioned that have been wearing fat passivity and disposed of a little bit of space time before coming away I do want to top of my time so my next holiday hack is to take away your body lotion also contain a hint of self time so this one is the summer body cream Gagne and it's very very subtle so no one's going to look for you at dinner and be like oh my god she's wearing three times so there's a focus of gradual tan they call it a moisturizing lotion for some kids look virtually build the natural King town and I definitely agree with I can use this in the UK but because it is so hydrating super fast absorbing and it's got apricot extract in there as well that smells lovely I just find the perfect thing for holidays so I am going to cover myself in this and not only be moisturized but build on my tan as well alright so my moisturizer has been thinking into the past five minutes I'm feeling super soft and my skin it smells absolutely amazing it's thanks for lovely apricot extract so over the next couple of days I'll keep using this every day morning and night and I will slowly but surely develop an even more beautiful and kissed hands of really just helps to like answer your holiday time next I'm going to do my face I've ever really spend any more than my five minutes doing my makeup on holiday I just keep it super natural of course cleansing my skin I did cleanse in the shower but I always would use my tan or water before starting my makeup a coarse Kanye my slaughter you guys are probably bored of hearing me raise bucket but I always carry one of you to the minis with me on holiday this one is the one that's really good for sensitive skin can use on your eyes your lips so because it's so gentle as well I find it really good for when you've been on beat your day if your skin perhaps a little bit sensitive from sun exposure but of course it just gets rid of any dirt and any traces of makeup so really just freshens up the complexion next I'm topping on my moisturizer I'm going to use the elements Pro collagen marine cream I've got a little mini and I've had lying around in my travel bag I'm determined to use it haven't even taken silver off it yet but I love using this at home it's one of my favourite dealing with drivers so it's really nice that I can just have something that I use regularly all the time and as part of my holiday make routines for my foundation this is a new webinar accessories from gellmann if they're aqua nude lingerie / foundation so this is a waterbased foundation again all about keeping the skin rehydrated and really library products and this one also plumps and hydrates the skin as you wear it you're really getting skincare benefits too it's a very light finish as well there is nothing worse to me than being kicked and make up when you are in a beautiful hot climate so I really love this is just such a lovely lightweight natural finish and I'm just blending this in with my Beauty Blender for my brows I'm not even going to try any product I'm just going to use the spoolie part of my brow pencil just to neaten up the shape I used I need eyebrow a couple of days before coming out here so they are naturally quite dark shape wise I just yeah a little bit wild but you know I don't really care too much when I'm abroad just keeping it quite natural a little bit of bronzer just to show you how to spend a day in the Sun this is the gun and terracotta Salma tonic and it's a waterproof one so this is basically most longlasting bronzer but I've ever tried really does the color go down can just do no wrong when it comes to bronzers in my opinion but yeah this one is particularly longlasting especially in humid climates and I actually love the color of this so much that I'm going to be using this as my eye shadow just taking a big fluffy blending brush sleeping it over the lid a very quick flick of mascara this is a trouble sized one from Bobbi Brown it's best smokey eye mascara I don't mind the scar in the daytime it is just add a little bit of drama to the look that's still keeping it really really natural and then my lipstick is in my handbag but finishing touches I'm going to use the Estee Lauder bronze goddess spray on oil this is their shimmering oil and on my goodness I just love cavities my skin not only does it smell amazing but it has these little shimmering particles in it so this is another holiday hat you can smell amazing and have a beautiful shimmering skin which readers enhance with your hands with products like this I think affordable product wise looks have got one but for me you cannot beat smell of acid or bronze goddess so this is my fave I like to put up my arms just patting it into the chest and then you don't need a perfume either so great multitasker okay I grabbed my makeup bag my lipstick that I'm using is the Double Wear stay in place lip liner in the shade rose because the rest of my look is totally natural I'm going to go a little bit more bold on a list so starting with the liner and finishing with the lip color this is pure color Envy in insatiable ivory again as they order you might recognize this from one of my previous vlogs because I told you how obsessed I am with this but this formula so nourishing is like the most perfect consistency the most perfect shade and it's almost like a balm as well so so many picks for this especially amazing for holiday we're just going to blot to make it last a little bit longer and we're done so I'm going to leave my hair damp this evening I really don't have any issue with going out with my hair dump obviously I've got the Garnier mask in there working its magic so this is my finished look as I said just super easy no more than 510 minutes absolute maximum and we're ready to go good morning so it's around 12 o'clock midday at the moment we have had a little bit of a tropical rainstorm this morning which is quite spectacular to watch actually here in the Caribbean because obviously it's a tropical island when it rains it absolutely torrential rains we had power cuts we had thunder we had lightning so yeah it was pretty spectacular but I used the time off the beach to get a little bit of work done so feeling good about having a productive morning I've also woken up a lot more bronze than when I went to sleep thanks to the summer body and Ambre Solaire I used last night so my holiday beauty hacks are working and also because we've just had this epic storm I feel like all the bugs are going to be out in force I've covered myself in the Avon oil that I was telling you about that's also a great mosquito repellent so fingers crossed I won't get bitten to death this morning because I'm going to meet the guys now for brunch and then we're going to head out for a rainforest Trek which I'm really excited about I don't really know how long we're going for and this is the only outfit I have with me that's remotely suitable so not the best prepared but I'm going to take my olympus tough camera with me so if it does start to heave again if the heavens open once again i will be prepared but first it's time for brunch so let's get going so we're back in the dry in the comforts of the beautiful hotel room after our adventure let's call it in the rainforest using the olympus touch we were trying to get some macro shots because it's a 4k camera and is amazing at getting these closeups so fingers crossed I managed to get some really good snaps but now after I actually just filmed a little beauty video which you guys may have seen already but now I'm going to be heading into the spa we're going to have a lovely 50minute Indian massage which I'm so excited about but I'm just about to meet J before that take a couple of outfit photos I've not worn stressed before you may recognize it from my aides or two loaded before we went so time some quick shots and then time to chill so it's already our final morning here in Antigua but the sun is shining again so all feeling very jolly we had an early morning 7:00 a.m. Pilates outs on the jetty again which is just such a lovely way to start the day it's already super super hot I've already got my glow on as you can see but I just headed out I'm going to spend the next I don't know half an hour or so I was going to be trying out the different lenses taking some snaps around the hotel very green very tropical so I'm going to try and get some most close up some nice tropical palm prints and then I think I'm going to ask Jay to take a few more outfit shots of me and make the most of every second while the sun is shining so let's go and get some sense so the last few moments here in beautiful Antigua we're blessed with another golden hour the light and time is ugly stunning so this strange guy that keeps following me around the camera Oh"	2960

comfortable in it so I'm just going to go and have a look and they've got a really good soft play there as well so we're going to do something with the kids and Matt might have the kids in the song play well I just quickly go to maybe one or two stores so that's the plan and maybe we'll have lunch together in everything okay so I'm going to take you along with us and also as you show you what I've got the boys for Valentine's Day because there's only a week away and I always get the boys something I just think it's a really nice little tradition that we've got into and I've got four men in my life that I have to buy for and I feel like I am the main woman in all of their lives at the moment so I always get them something so this is a gift that we have got the boys and I'll probably get

children's books that we've had poppy has had it of it so I put this new lovely like hardback bound book it's a really sweet story and it's all about love so it's really fitting for Valentine's Day so I was thinking this would be a really lovely gift for them or this would also be a really nice gift to get from the kids to maybe daddy so that daddy didn't like read it to them and stuff like that but yeah it's got really lovely wording in it and the boys regularly like stretch out see I love you this much or I love you to the moon and back because that's kind of like the wording in this book as well and I'll show you what I've written it inside whenever I buy a book as a present for someone I always like personal message inside it because I think that's like a Remo keepsake and then every time you go back to read that book it has like the wording in the front cover so I'll show you so this is it here and then when you open it up I just written to Jackson Caleb and Fraser I love you right up to the moon and back love mommy and daddy and I put Valentine's Day 2017 not than that and then I've also got them to guess how much I love you coloring book which also has stickers in it

our website have some really nice little wedding gift outfits on there and and then maybe if there's nothing there then maybe Ted Baker's as they always do really nice like wedding getting things I would also say caramel in but the caramel in for like really thin people quite curvy at the moment but that's important an emphasis on on their balances collide but it looks like all the police colors yeah anyway on our way husband music usually get in the buggy now why not let my just tried on about saving dresses and there was one muscle with okay but is to incidentally found selecting from older is really a lot of money for one last thought was okay so we're going to keep trying but it's not easy with too little one right you just come to get lunch and I've got some amazing looking wasabi salad yeah so it's not really that healthy but it looks really good Oh I'd love to be however I have no dress I've come with nothing and I only returned one of the things I had returned and yes thanks

enough of the very sexist and kind of controlled environment that she has within her school life and so she takes it upon her but to try and change that I just found it to be a really empowering book I wish I had read when I was younger I mean I enjoyed reading it now I just wish I had a read this when I was younger I'm going to read you the back because I feel like it gives it a great summary Vivian kata is better so that was the sexist dress code fed up with the growth comments from guys during her class fed up with her high school teachers who let it happen but most of all Bibb is fed up with always following the rules fifth norm of the punkrock riot girl inspired inspiring verb to create Moxie feminist theme that she distributes anonymously to her classmate she's just blowing off steam but other girls respond and begin to spread the Moxie message and then on the back it says Moxie Girlz bite back and before bears know that she has started with girl revolution I really liked it because it focused quite a lot on friendship I really like that one of her friends wasn't so sure about it sometimes I feel like the word feminist does kind of confuse people or they feel kind of conflicted by what they feel that word means and I feel like Jennifer really addresses this very well in the book and there's the kind of should I shouldn't I is this going to work am I going to be back like if anyone else in agreement with me is this going to really make a difference and I love following the journey that she goes on not just with what she's trying to achieve but also within herself because I think she isn't the sort of girl that would per self out there in that way and you can really tell that by doing this she's also overcoming quite a lot of her personal hangups as well which I also really really like it has a little bit of romance because you know everyone loved a lot of story so yeah I just loved it it was something different and I haven't read anything like this when I was a young adult I like possibly uh nano anymore probably not but I I genuinely think it's a very empowering book great to bring awareness to equality and feminism and just to kind of know I I think it's a salt book that should be passed around and a lot of people should read it I really really enjoyed it I lost Jennifer's writing style her characters are very vivid I loved Vivian at the main character and generally I don't like main correct I don't know why I just don't I don't ever really like a main character I will always like a different character that doesn't have such a big role within a book but I really like the Vivian in the main character and is already thoroughly enjoyed it and I really think that you guys go to has why I picked it so Moxie is exclusive to wh Smith for the duration of the book club so you can only get this on WH Smith website or install and as always all seven of the other book titles have their exclusive covers WH Smith as well which I always love because then all of them together look so great I'm going to I'm going to show you look they look so great if you guys want to find out more about the other seven books I haven't talked about in depth in this video then head on over to WH Smith co uk boy slash zoella book club for a lot more information and also I would advise that you guys follow the author's social media channels like Twitter and things because they'll have lots more exclusive content over there and reviews of the book as well if you guys head out and buy any of these books from the book club as always make sure you are tweeting using the hashtag zoella book club so that I can read what you guys think of these and we can all have a bit of a book discussion I think that's one of the many reasons I like doing this is because it opens up a discussion about reading and about book and about what people like or dislike about certain books and I also just loved how much you guys all love book clubs it's so refreshing and yeah I did love it so let me know what you think if you've read any of these already and if you recommend any or if there's any that you're super excited to read yes a bit then I will be thank you again this is this is a blog so I've got more of the day to go but yes I'm very very excited and I hope you want to it's a bit later on and I am currently trying to sort much Oh No hmm I'm trying to stop my office out I just feel like it's a neverending like process I know it has to get Messier before I get tidier I remember my dad once telling me you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs so I'm at the breaking egg stage right now and I can't wait to be on work you know actually like on this which is weird because I like cheese I like veg and I like eggs and I would eat scrambled eggs with things it's it's just an omelette I don't know I digress so this is currently what's happening in here focus just just I mean I bought a massive disco ball because I wanted to put it up in here turns out it was way too big so I think I'm going to have to like put this in the dining room on the floor or something I'm not too sure and I just realized that I am a complete stationary addict I hoard stationary so I have this whole thing so I have this whole thing full I have this that's full and bit bees and all my sharpies and I've just saw some more oh yeah over here no one needs that many hens and felt tips so I need to get rid of some I think it's about time I also realized that I heard washi tape I have a lot of washi tape it's all very pretty I really like that it fits in this compartment but I don't actually remember the last time I used washi tape maybe it's because I feel like I couldn't find it it felt it is normally the sort of thing that you check at the bottom of drawer and never find again because it's so small so I'm wondering whether that happened so I just kept buying more and more and more and now because I'm having a massive sort out it's all here I think I have some sort of system in my head but I have ordered loads of acrylic Muji storage and I really want to find my label maker I feel like I can't label things I'm putting like important documents in these but I need to label those properly because some of them don't matter in them now and I've opened every single box up here and my label machine is not up here so I've obviously misplaced a box so I think we need to choose hunter that what I done in here today oh I'm watching loads of like mining marked logs which I think oh I'm really blue which could be a bit weird but they make me really healthy and I like this and some in the background and it's like good times it reminds me of funny things so I think I've pretty much finished these okay this lighting is crazy and oh I put all these draw all the other lighting seminormal I don't know I fill it gray I've put all these in here and put loads of Stephanie ethic so I've worked a lot a hoard stationary and I hoard Christmas and Easter and Halloween decorations because all this is Christmas like how terrifying is that that is horrific this attic space you have to send when you're in here like this I'm which kind of hurt then when you have the look the heavy box you feel like I don't know a crooked a crooked old man or some face but yeah it's a bit creepy so I'm getting out I think I'm going to put all my filming lights and tripods in here but so far we've just got one lonely tripod and Alpha's lost the top of it which makes me so sad because they are the hardest thing to find and I have no doubt in my mind that he has no idea where he put that anyway I'm probably going to end this vlog here because I'm going to have some food and probably have a bath and go to bed because I have to be up really early tomorrow I'm driving to somewhere cool I can't remember what it's called but it's somewhere near Northampton for a meeting and I have to be nekkid 10:30 so I think it works out but I have to set off at a.m. so I have to be up quite early so I will of course bring you with me and I will see you tomorrow just let you know I'm being really quiet right it's now 7:00 a.m. we're in the car ready to go and it says that we are going 146 miles apparently it's not Northampton it's more north than Northampton has just got back it was a threehour drive there and a threehour 10minute drive back which actually wasn't too bad although the weather has taken a turn and it's now like super rainy but I kind of like it because we haven't had like a rainy cozy day in this house yet so I feel like now I can turn on the fire and we can make it really cozy and basically the whole journey me and Kerri will get excited about autumn and winter which is no surprise really because we do anyway when it gets to June it was a really good meeting and I'm really happy with it and yeah I've got a few deliveries so we're going to unbox those and then I think I can have a bath because my legs ache but look at this this is just a few delivery we're going to try and get rid of them quickly for Alfie get back get so they're all gone it's going to be like what the hell of you only a couple of bit it's mostly office storage to be fair probably wouldn't excite Alfie but I'm not going to like does excite me a little bit excuse the fact I look like a cotton bud but I was just editing the vlog and it ended so abruptly basically I open the boxes and I went to bed I was so tired I'm so excuse the fact that I have three cold sores in the cluster on my lip it's so sore I hope you enjoyed this vlog don't forget to check out all the links I will leave in the description box for all the WH Smiths but the club staff and grandfather the authors and yeah I am going to spend the day doing more boxes in my office so a season goes by"	3480

day without a morning backflip all right let's go we're all good we're ready it's time for breakfast today we're switching things up a bit papi and I you know how competitive we are we literally turn anything into a challenge you do would you know we're doing Bobby's can turn this into a challenge of who turns it into a challenge so Kellogg's going Dutch and they have asked us to use the hashtag because the arm and see who can make the most delicious bowl of cereal I mean poppy has a food blog a website I mean not I've read it or anything that would probably help and I don't even say this you have not made it that this cute this is okay not it's not you think it is basically Special K original crunchy nut Coco Pops cornflakes Rice Krispies bran flakes milk cranberries apple banana yogurt Kiwi I don't know I'm doing this you know what these are blackberries blueberries honey strawberries raspberries we've got these got bowls these are nice aren't they I see oh that would help with next spoon how are we going to do this we don't want at a time a little spoon how are we going to do this well whatever wait no now probably gets so excited let's do it eat your hair do you want to take turns doing this I don't even so you make your mother from say a beastie affair I should do my fur for saying that you do yourself I'm going to go out the rhythm for five I mean the gardener member leave the camera view you make a bowl of cereal and then get that and then I'll come back in to make mine now I'm poppy she's probably going to make some like fancy like a blueberry inside a strawberry in place on top it's not all about the aesthetics it's about what it tastes like you know got to have a delicious breakfast in the morning to get you up get you energized get you back to put on the trampoline and that's kind of like pop is first cooking YouTube video or bees or any moment you think mine's getting better national Watts make it at the same time no I see and that is what your Savior gonna work better together know who don't work as a team it's 19 top is called him back in because she thinks it's going to be better if we make the food at the same time I wouldn't see what you're doing because you're that competitive you can't even make a bowl of cereal without me hard right I'm going to start making mine then you can pop it let me see what pop is doing and then I can take her you catch at six oh that is right that is what we call well you're making using some piece of art that doesn't make it taste any better just remember that remember that one will taste your mind open heart you never so normal here it always extremely yeah but are you doing yoga or are you gonna milk yeah stage one complete we've got the cereal there halfandhalf in mind I meant the decorating if you're also a double cereal person like me I'm actually honest I've never actually had I've never had two shows at once or are playing a risky card here cornflakes and Special K new you

don't lie as well you've got to actually say I like the crunch of the bunching that I like is a fruit the only thing I don't know how keen them on is you're going to say smell yeah I'm always milk always milk so I'll probably rate that solid three I joke it no being serious I would eat that for breakfast that tastes really good however if you switch the yoga out with milk I think it would be nine out of ten maybe even the pain that's my favorite fruit as well you're just missing Madonna remember they eat it up remember you need just stop although it is breakfast time we've spent so long we've spent so long making these that were like when you have to enjoy in a second just remember the minds got the duo blend the double lid open glow dry heart Special K half cornflakes banana blueberry drizzle of honey mmhmm you ready open your mouth now I know you have to get a bit of everything on there that's important okay I'm a suburbanite yeah the milk of cereal ratio is good that's

oh I've wanted that by Jenny meaning is a really cool present have you ever have you guys seen those like it's like a smartphone project so you can stick your phone in there I've never like seen in real life but I've seen them everywhere and then it projects outside like you can watch stuff if you're watching me like YouTube video you can stick it in and project it like on to order something there you go that's what it looks like you stick your phone in the back here and then it projects that out onto the wall I think that's a really really cool present so I'm gon get that one okay I'm also buying alpha something online not going to show you that just because out of anyone even if I say don't watch this you guys will probably tweak to him or he'll watch it because Alfie's like when

they're all in my shopping basket and I'm at checkout personally when I shop online I always use paypal for me it's a lot easier and I think a lot of people don't realize that we pay how you can like link your card to it so you know when you want to buy stuff online you could go on and you have to enter your card details every time and it's like a bit of a mesh well when you have your paypal like you just put it in once then it stores in it just honesty does make it a lot easier like I genuinely use paypal for like pretty much everything online i have it for my netflix account my spotify account and my shoe shopping and when i make online purchase because it is just easier you can give us a stun what a stunt yeah trying to stun yeah this is no Oh should I show you want to try you're

"yes_CHILLING at Home"	"hey guys welcome to what day is that the tenth of April today I woke up at home for the first time in ages I'm sitting on my bed it's made it's like half past eleven right now and I'm awake and piggies here hello Wiggles I was very excited to you last night wasn't I piggy so today I have one day at home for a head off to Coachella tomorrow morning and I am basically doing an absolute shed ton of admin and trying to recover from jet lag I'm actually not feeling too bad because I had a few days in Amsterdam but I have to unpack everything and sort my life out before I head off again tomorrow so this log is actually sponsored by Leonor which sounds kind of different for me because obviously it's not something I normally kind of talk about obviously when you're traveling you want your clothes to smell good and stay fresh and I am having to basically turn around about half of my wardrobe in terms of washing in one day so hopefully I will be left with very soft goodsmelling clothes by the end of the day so this is a sensing question it's from Lenore's new inspired by nature collection it's their silk tree blossom fabric conditioner which is actually pretty fitting considering I've just been in Japan and the silk tree blossom is from Japan the product is all about being inspired by nature and kind of learning how to switch off from everyday life and kind of letting nature back into your life which is exactly what I do when I get home because I live in the countryside and I feel like traveling all the time you're kind of on planes on trains in cars in the air like constantly going sometimes it can be really hard to switch off so even though I've got busy day today it's going to be kind of a relaxed one because I am at home I am kind of spending time with my dogs and yeah let's do this guys let's see what I get up to today and if we can actually find some time to chill out I'm hoping so so the first thing that's hard about today is actually stopping myself just from puddling Pig little day the biggest time waster look at this little face and the giant paws Oh piggy I do love you so it actually got pretty organized for Coachella before I left for Japan because I knew I had a really tight turn over so I have a load of my stuff kind of folded and ready here but it's actually not too organized also something else that just arrived in the post today and I want to show you because it is so cool check out this customized jacket perfect for Coachella it's actually from a new company called I don't quite know how to pronounce it and ha but they made it especially for me for Coachella so yeh I'm also going to put a face mask whilst I am packing because my skin gets so dry when I travel and so when I'm home I like to look after it today I'm using the pharmacy hydrating coconut one which is one of my faves and I'm going to pop it on and tie my hair up probably is also out of the way but it's just so super kind of cooling and hydrating really nice another thing I do when I'm home is spot clean all of my brushes which actually doesn't take you long with one of those tedious things that I put off let's crack on with it go leave these here to dry for a little bit and go and check my washing first wash is done time for change and a dry I am now in the car with this one and we are on our way to love it we have three unhappy pooches in the boot there I realize you and they have not realized they probably think that they're going to see my mom to be honest but we're on our way to the back to give them their annual kind of checkup has also got to get their sleeve work master because we had fun in the process but cheapest stuff they have to have like the logistics were more clear and it's the first time a new net and we both have to go because all three have them together if your cow whoa whoa sweet child o mine which way this is going to be pandemonium which is going good squid which algae pandemonium right now piglets definitely going to need making ups you will not walk into that trauma in their fingers being so noisy barking everybody packing mission is nearly complete I don't know how I pack so heavily guys I used to be final just one suitcase now I have three walk in the dogs my favorite part of being home always hey Pepe not on a lead risky risky this is a go on in daffodil time trickles favorite pastime is trampling daffodil what a monkey Vicki that be someone has found something probably disgusting what are you eating what's he chomping on hmm come on give us company

Bolognese yeah we didn't have we don't have any SpaghettiOs my fault if I do the shopping earlier but we're actually heading over to my friend Lisa's house actually her brother's house she's basically

"yes_Come Shopping With Me  AD  The Anna Edit.txt"	"hi everyone so this week's vlog is gonna be a little bit different it's gonna be more of like a mini blog like people come shopping with me type thing if you can hear noises in the background and really so Matt mark is having like the noisy issue next door and it's currently a Sunday we've just got ready had a very lazy morning and then we're gonna go into town and run a couple of errands which is where this comes in because this video is sponsored by boots I love boots I have done for absolute years and they're actually celebrating 20 years at the advantage card you know you like the rewards card let me find your mind it's in the purse I always carry it around with me then it's very wellloved actually this little bad boy hasn't been around for 20 years it's definitely been around probably for about ten because I think I've had this since I was 16 it was like one of the first things you know when you turn like a certain age and you're like oh now I can apply for this I literally got it the minute that I could have here and over the years I've accumulated a lot of points on it I think I currently have around eighty one pound fifty s worth of points but last time I saw it comes at the bottom of your receipt how many points you've got on your rewards card and I was like who okay yeah I think it's defendant but over the years I have spent my points for lots of different things I remember buying the Dior and like lip flow like the little lip glow thing I bought that I brought to your air flash with it as well back in the day and then when I was at uni I bought lots of mil deals with it it got me through times when I was quite hungry and I got to have the good old mill deal that was great I mean I practically picked my university because there was a boots on campus but nothing and uni there is a boots on campus cuz boots is from Notting in and it was just absolutely fab but I can't believe it's been around for 20 years so in September they're celebrating and many happy reports and there are lots of different metal offers amazing things going on I'll make sure that will link down in the description box below through but I'm basically gonna go along today and do a bit of a boot school which sounds like a great way to spend or some day if you ask me if you don't already have a boots advantage card then I don't know why not because for me it is like the best reward scheme out there you get four points for every pound and that is just sad that they do that all year round and they have so many amazing events where you think get extra points if you spend a certain skincare and things like that so that's why I've managed to accumulate so many throughout the years and I basically just buy everything I need beauty wise there I get my cotton pads from there obviously by beauty things from there there's just a great range of products and you can apply for the card either online there is an app you get think great offers that tailor to you they're like come through the post and you get a little coupons and stuff you can spend them either instore and online as well I just think it's the best it's why it's always in my purse and say yeah I'm basically gonna take mark along with me into town we're going to run a couple of errands and then I'm gonna make him follow me around in Boots this is a bit of a UK drugstore haul as well and I'm gonna come back and kind of throw it on my face and do a bit of a Tryon with it as well so have you like this like this running right that's going to town as if you didn't want to attention to be drawn to you more enjoy see you later bye I think we're gonna take up a repurchase of this this is the bronzing mousse so like it's pricey one is so good but then I think I might try this on as well the Southtown Express bronzing mist not the meat I won't get my good deal okay what's the justification okay table mini cold baby I'm always running out so you get that's all really good look at it it's that sure like goodlooking lock handle I'm actually gonna pick up a blood orange embed what paddywhack scandal that only Marx trying to put that in my face what ones that I smells amazing well that's not amazing passionfruit and guava oh that smells really nice too I think I'm gonna stick with the original one though because it's my mum's birthday Oh today it's my mom's birthday today I should really drop our text I'm seeing her later on so I think I might get heavy for her birthday mark got in there before me strike two you didn't even like you didn't even give him a fault in your life basically every time I cut on one because it's my favorite shampoo and it's like 20 quid I forget it with my point get it okay marks wandered off knees come back with these it was just this charger but still a good purchase in the basket they go and whilst you left me I found this this is from SD and it is a treat unloved color and it's like a bit of a base coat thing in the shade shares to you and it looks like it kind of wants to say it's a strengthener for normal to dry and brittle nails so i got in as well for at the next concert and a lovely lady who works it's really sweet and was chatting awaiting for me i just recommended me this this is the soft matte lip cream in happen try to on the back of my hand looks like a good kind of I can see that looking about it they're like mashed paradise mascara which normally it's not available in water yet so not there be like that and then I'm cuz I've got my lash like lips going on at the moment I feel like I can hide attacks long water that's cool happening and I've seen every one side always sharp lipliner in I feel like I just need a bit of a lip liner sometime my lip line is great sorry one that's like pinky and like not to you need mmm that one looks kind of like pinky and not to eat sometimes I just like to do a bit of a lip line I'm not really wearing my child from her lips though like so we've moved really far now we to the other side of the Smashbox counter it's the smashbox cameraready CC cream you guys know I love CC I think I know that you like CC creams alright I feel like I've heard you note mentioned them before you know it looks like my single moment I like your finger to get my all it's only have actually seen before any of it and this isn't boots now personally that extra strength but it's an efficient that goes down like that and they eat these are the best oh I know so chopping about it the girls none of my friends they're always asking me where you can get these from that's what you're going to get me in sense these now polish and Riva things here in the boots Brighton store and look at the nail polish section just have a word brother this is the best these are the best cotton world that the cotton wool doublefaced brown pads it's the only column world that I use tends to always be I might buy one yes like another half price always make a book like Monroe heaven forbid might impact I'll over then I didn't know that they would be okay no I'm not very stable I'm not very stable I didn't actually sell this privately souk in SEK I am much about how you say it I think before I tried their nail polish remover and it's like something pardon free it's a very natural brand now she's really well priced like that says scrubbing up selling found likes fun things I might try a lot I do have a big rock we've got detoxifying clay Mars Oh antipollution I'm not going to try to facial moisturizer and I'm going to try detoxifying supergreens playlists I think all that care has done had a rather full basket yeah when I get home I will kind of take you through and I'm going to try a couple of meetings on my facebook right so I'm back and I've taken out all over Marc's things there on the floor there for him kind of joint purchases we may need I'll quickly take you through my repurchases I mean the load of cata move double faced round bags like I said they're the only cotton ball that I use so I'm quite happy that I've got a lot more of those to keep me going the Sanpei selftan express the bronzing mousse I needed to pick up another one of these I always pick up a Bumble and Bumble sundae shampoo these might not be the most exciting purchases but I love a good travel mini so the Colgate healthy clean the mini little toothpaste there you go perfect size for like a week or two away so these would be really handy for New York and also a mini Mitchum powder fresh deodorant as well mitchum is the only thing that works for me I've mentioned all the time that I'm a complete sweaty Betty and these are great gift wise I picked up this from my mum today and she actually text mark back before me saying thank you for the birthday message like I am super offended by it now but it is a paddywhacks soy wax candle my mom loves candles I think we we definitely share that she's passed that down to me and it is the blood orange and bergamot it smells so good I know she's really really gonna like that but under the new things there's a couple of new things I can't really demonstrate to you in this video and one of them is such a selftan Express the bronzing mist so I'm guessing this could be a little bit easier than the mousse and that you kind of just spray it on and then sort of buff it in with a little mitt so it could be a little quicker and I think I'm going to do a quick little time before I go into my honestly haven't and for yonks and feel like I need a bit of like sun kiss back in my life so I will let you know how that one goes and I'll let you know how this one goes as well the seeking detoxifying a clay mask supergreens it was great comfy that brand in there that looks right up my street I'll probably do that tonight as a bit of a like preflight pamper and then I actually just use this this is the nail polish from either extrastrength the one in the pub bottle absolutely genius I had some clear nail polish on my nails I just got rid of that before I try on this se one it worked really well oh it's developed to remove glue and glitter but how good is that but the first thing that I can try on my face and I have got a bit of face on at the moment so this isn't really a true test but it is the smashbox cameraready CC cream i pick this up in the shade light i just thought that this looked really glowy and I've honestly gone in probably for like the last year and just watched it and been like I think I want it but not actually purchase it so I'm quite happy finally just got around to it I quite like that I feel like it looks quite glowy on the skin very natural it's very quick to blend the color match was good for me they actually had quite a lot of shades across the board as well which is good so that's good for a CC cream I think this is coming to New York with me along with my teeth base and the other thing that I bought was this this is the L'Oreal lash paradise mascara got the same kind of run goin about asperity rose gold E and like I said I put a lash lift at the moment I haven't got anything on my eyelashes right now but it means I don't have to go for waterproof mascara wow there's a lot of bristles going on there I feel like this is gonna give super loads of volume oh yeah there's quite a lot of volume going on here so this one obviously has it and this one doesn't I like that though it's quite nice when you have the lash lifting you don't have to go for waterproof formulas I feel like there's just a whole new world of mascaras that I've been like opened up to I'm excited to try this the Smashbox always sharp lip liner in nude fair I think this is like a good color for me so it's not too Brown yeah that's really nice by pink that's a really natural color for me but it's definitely defined my lip line a little bit so I like that and I think if you twist it so we sharp it's sharpened again oh I so genius so then I'm gonna put on a bit of the NYX soft matte lip cream I know that I like these I have two shades can and also the shades Stockholm and it's just a really nice liquid lipstick formula I mean I feel like a lot of liquid lipsticks out there can be quite drying quite matte thick on the lips but this is very natural really kind of slippy on the lips bit dries down map and I like that and this is Athens which I'm actually going to in October so there you go I think that could be a new favorite lip color there I love that that's just such a good kind of nudie peachy but is still quite like bright little bit summery a really good pairing with the lip liner as well so thank you to the lovely girl on the council that had a little chat with and she recommended that that was such a good show and then the final thing that I'm going to try is this the Essie treat love and color strengthener in the shade sheers to you great name but like I said I've just taken off what now polish I did have so they're looking a bit I mean they're fine but they're just looking a bit kind of boring and there's not much shine going on there so hopefully this will add a little bit of shine back into things so I painted it on and now it's just like a bit of iridescent to my nail and normally I am NOT about that iridescent life on my nails but I think it sort of made them look a little bit more glowy and shiny which I really like and hopefully it should strengthen them as well which I am so down for so that is the end of this little come shopping with me episode slash mega haul I have definitely got a lot more points on my groups advantage card now but hopefully this is giving you some inspiration of what to spend your points on I'm very happy with all of my purchases and very happy to partner with boots in this video because like I said I have been using them for years and this comes very naturally to me but thank you so much for watching definitely check out the description box below to see the special offers they have on during the weekends this month but thanks for watching and I'll see you on Sunday a brand new video bye"	2959

the car thank you for helping Josh had to get him to help me pull it out we've got all of this stuff around me and I think I'm gonna do like the little whole section of this vlog tomorrow morning with very excited I've just been showing Josh everything I got do you like everything yeah yeah yeah hello hello yeah I will see you tomorrow at all very good morning so it is the next day and as promised I am doing the whole part of this video and I'm still so happy with everything I bought Bessie this pillow I love I think it's gonna go really nicely in our bedroom because it's got the like creamy colors it's also got like a little bit of pink in there and some like natural tones as well and this was $24.99 I always find that the home scents pillows like they come with the cushion inside them as well so it's not just like the cushion cover they're just like so so much more affordable than a lot of the other ones out there that will be blog posts on this so I will let you know on like social media say follow me on Twitter Instagram if you want to know when that is our then we have this rogue hope it doesn't get fluff 11 makes this black dress everything clings to it and I love it this is gonna go perfectly in the bedroom Nala has already christened this if I can insert the video of her like loving life on this in here I will because it is just so freaking cute um speaking of hello hello yeah I'm super happy with this they also did it in like a longer version that was very much more pink which was so tempted to get for the office but I think the office is like has enough in it now and I don't want things to get like overwhelming and cluttered yeah I just thought this one this was $34.99 oh my god it's so gorgeous don't need to insert that cutaway now because this this is it you get a live show the best fit is if she starts on like a far point of it because because she worms her way across there okay that's going to be distracting at all so the first thing in this bag of lightly talked bits is this candle it's a sweet almond pumpkin candles smells so good it's like fresh pumpkin like it smells like a pumpkin dessert it's just really really gorgeous so I can't wait to burden it in like before two months and then I also got this me and Alex got one each I think this is so cute so I'm gonna make some kind of Halloween style punch I don't got this candle and a car smell this is Oh how much were these things actually this was $5.99 which the candle that size so good and then this was $7.99 and then this one it was $7. as well and this is cool I liked this it has a real marble lid so when I'm done with this it's gonna be so nice to like store things in and it's got a really nice fresh like lemony citrusy smell it's really really gorgeous they did a few different sense in that kind of style jar as well if you're not fine citrusy stuff you might still like that and then I got this which is um I'm storing a lot of things in this basket ever Sulli I did pick up this I think you saw me put it in the trolley this is like a real marble slate like a so heavy the quality of it is freaking amazing and this was $12.99 which I think it's awesome so I think this is gonna go really nicely in our kitchen actually they've got some bowls as well like homes it's just so good like the really cool things that like really different so like the rug and these cushions but they do like great everyday basics like kitchenware bowls glasses great for everything but these are so cute I love these these are little bowls and they're actually from the pet section this one was $2.99 and the other one was too nice known as well this one's my favorite but I like the fact that rather than having two that were the same I wanted like op ones so there's gonna be knowledge new people's face for the dog bowls then I got Josh and myself some bowls and these are really cute I like the texture of them on the outside this one's got like a honeycomb texture I really like the honeycomb like hexagon shapes it's got this pattern on the inside and this one has more of a like diamond pattern and then on the inside so I got two of each of those so I have four in total and these were three ninja 90 which I thought was pretty good and normally end up being a little bit more than that when I buy my balls so I was really happy with that then I lost my shoes for these as you who live scene so these are the most gorgeous like open marble coasters they've got the little sticky things on the bottom which is great so it's not gonna like mess up your coffee table and it's got like a copper trim they have onto the gold trim as well but they were heartshaped and I like the kind of natural Ness of these shapes and these were 999 which i think is so good because the other coasters that I've been buying are like for pounds and we always need more coasters I don't know what it is just oh god about this oh I love this so much this is like a little ramekin style thing and I have one of these already in white and this vise or as I call oh my god is pink is beautiful and it was $2.99 though so good and then we have the basket which I really really liked I love this kind of multi texture it's just like a really nice storage basket and I think it's gonna come in really handy and then the final thing from that Bowl was this what Plantard thing I love this you guys will know I love the ones with like the legs and it's got gold legs and then the top is like a terracotta color and I just think this is absolutely gorgeous I think it will work really beautifully in our bedroom now I'm introducing like a few more brownie colors into the mix this is one of the final items and I love this think this was the first thing I picked up I'm so happy with everyone T like a fairy its style stool for a really really long time and I love the fun that this one has wooden legs instead of gold because I love gold accents but I do think too much of one thing is really annoying when you kind of over that because you're let then stuck with loads and loads of stuff that is all one metal or one time and so I really like the fact that this just has wooden legs it matches a lot of the wooden furniture you know house already so it's not like a completely different tone and it's that kind of brownie taupey fur that's kind of a little bit pink but not like pink pink yeah I think this has the potential to be able to like move around rooms which makes it really versatile and just a really good purchase and also I was looking at the tag on this and not everything has this like on the tags but quite often when you look at the labels that say the price that says like its original retail price so its original RFP was a hundred and twenty five pounds and this was $59.99 and it was a really good nice little saving on that I've seen a lot of other fit stores I've been looking at and they were and lot more expensive I feel like I've got a really good bargain there and now I'm gonna show you the final thing so this is the armchair that we've bought I'm just going to take this pillow off this pillows from home since by the way it's gorgeous it's got this like herringbone fabric to it I've seen a lot of these and they were all very velvet in texture and that kind of style and I like the fact that this wasn't that because once that trend is over you know you're stuck with a load of velvet stuff I already have one other velvet piece so I didn't want to velvet armchairs so I think this is a really nice option it's very neutral it's got a really pretty texture it's comfortable to sit in as well and then like I said this pillow is from HomeSense and I bought this separately the yeah that was $29.99 lots people asked about the price for those pillows yeah I really like this and this chair was a total bargain as well I think the tag but was on it that said the original RP has been taken off I feel like it was something around 200 marked like pounds reduced to a hundred and fifty 999 which I was really really happy with I'm so happy with it I love it I think it's gonna look really nice in our bedroom but it also looks really nice it so is one of those things that again is going to move around the house we have quite a lot of family and we have this like three seater sofa which looks a mess right now I'm just going to sort that out and then we have the armchair that's over in the bay and apart from that we don't really have like a lot of seating so that arm sure is gonna be really handy I think that is going to be it for this come shopping with me at home all kind of blog really hope you guys like this let me know if you'd like me to do more like this I hope you guys have all enjoyed watching it and you were having a lovely day and I was see you guys again in my next video hope you can't hear neither crunching away at her food oh my god the drillings back I'm just gonna go bye"	3364
"yes_COOKING MY PARENTS DINNER WITH JAMIE OLIVER.txt"	"I managed to get up pretty early again today I woke up at about ten minutes past seven chilled in bed for a bit on my phone and stuff and now I've just come downstairs and made myself the biggest coffee in the entire world like this is literally like a bobble and now I'm just sitting down to edit my birthday blog which I'm so excited for that this is these are the kind of moments that I absolutely love that I daily vlog being able to walk back like forever for the rest of my life possibly my children's lives possibly my grandchildren's lives we're gonna be able to watch back my 24th birthday because I filmed it all and I edited it all together and I put it up put it out there into the world online on YouTube how sick is that that is that that is the core that is the simplicity that vlogging is capturing moments in my life and being able to watch them back in the future and whatever one of you guys watch them or whatever ten million of you guys watch them that doesn't really matter the fact that I can watch you my children can watch it my grandchildren can watch it my parents can watch it my grandparents can watch yeah today's also an extra special day for two other reasons I'll explain why later on I somehow need to carry all of these microphones and this thing here to the to the office with my laptop as well this is not going to be good I know what I'm like a literally smashed my iPhone screen like three days ago did I show you where luckily it's my work phone not my personal I've never seen an iPhone screen corrupt as much as that trip number two to the office taking some donuts over with me right the first reason today is an exciting day is because we've got a new team member joining the team officially usually it's just me and my PA who sits here but as of today is sitting here the newest desk I'm a little bit out of breath getting in those morning backflips you know joining us is a creative producer so she is sick of photography sick of graphic design if you saw any of the pictures from the sub life xpb popup shop on the instagrams and stuff she took all of those if you saw any of the designs or the gifts for the popup shop she made all of those she's been working with us over the last two weeks just odd little days but today she officially starts fulltime in the office joining the team to help design and take photos and just just to creatively produce stuff for future projects I nearly said something I nearly need something but I'm not like I'm not getting the whole point of expanding the team and as you guys know hopefully I'm going to expand the team up to seven people pretty soon is so that I can step back from other stuff behind the camera and have people who are better than me at that stuff join and I can spend more of my time making actual videos because as you know I get so much of my time sucked away off of camera doing admin and emails and business meetings and by hiring all the best people that I can find it means that I can spend all of my time making all of the best content I can possibly make for you guys that's why I'm buying new setups like this that's run by new cameras at the moment that's why I'm going to launch fat mouth Witness blog channel my gaming channel I'll be able to put more time into all of those things what's the new team are smashing everything else behind the scenes it's gonna be sick it's gonna be so so sick just finished up a couple of meetings at the office super excited today it is time for exciting thing number two in this video and this I'm ever since I've been sorting this thing out I've been so so excited you know in youtubers or when social media people team up with brands they team up with companies to promote their products if you watch YouTube if you have an Instagram account you will see that kind of stuff happening well today I don't even know how this has become a thing I like you all know that I'm good friends with Jamie Oliver and Jamie has got a new book out one minute let me put you guys out here it's up on my shelf in my kitchen you may have seen that I've had this book for a while this is Jamie Oliver's new book gave me all of her five ingredients quick and easy food as seen on Channel four this dude here this is my mate Jamie Oliver I've been chatting today let me pull up a seat let's have a chat I've been chatting to Jamie about this book and texting each other and dim DMM each other on Instagram stuff for bloomin ages and I was chatting to him and we were talking about his TV show on channel 4 where he's cooking recipes from this book long story short because I could just ramble and ramble on about times that me Jamie have had together playing poker going out for dinner and long story short penguin the publishers of this book here penguin asked me if I wanted to cook some recipes from the book in a video and I was like oh of course of course a bloomin do so via text and Jamie been like oh I'm working with your book like I'm working with your book and you're my mate and like this is crazy so penguin said we're happy for you to just do whatever you think whatever works with you and I said okay let me chat to Jamie let me see what he's saying let me see what I can think and I thought the best thing that I could possibly do because Jamie is such a family man the last time I was with him I was eating dinner at his table in his kitchen with his family like with his daughters with his wife Jules like we're literally all sat together eating a delicious dinner so I thought the best thing that I could possibly do for this video would be for me I'm gonna cook dinner tonight for my parents and I'm gonna cook it from this book the first thing I need to do is actually decide on what I'm gonna cook each of these meals I'm just gonna open it on a random page that me or their dads or does that not look ridiculous dazzl does that not look savage that looks like what you would get in like a fivestar restaurant that's what five ingredients everyone's got five things in their fridge Jamie man what you've actually done is made cooking possible for somebody like me somebody who doesn't constantly have a full fridge of amazing food like five ingredients you could do this at uni you could do this at college you could there's no excuses now not to be cooking delicious food and this it's not even just like meals there's desserts so I do a dessert for my parents oh I didn't even think of I could do a Maine and all my frozen banoffee cheesecake I've only just had my breakfast and I'm already wanting cheesecake so I've told my parents that I am cooking them dinner tonight they probably expect me to just like take over a takeaway they've already don't expect me to actually be like proper cooking something smoky chorizo salmon yes shopping list two times although let's go four times so stop with the ingredients because there's three of us 150 grams salmon two people in minutes this takes 11 minutes to cook cherry chocolate mousse total time minutes served six people that's what we're gonna go with today living that I'm so excited they should be excited they should be so excited actually I'm excited as well because I get to eat it all okay I'm gonna text Jamie now and see if whilst I'm cooking it to Mike tonight my parents see if he's around for a FaceTime to try and help me cook like whilst I'm like cooking on their Hobbs and they're having everything going and mixing bowls up and stuff I'm gonna FaceTime and be like bro am I doing this right I'm not doing the wrong he doesn't know yet I'm gonna get him to help me out video or not i think i started too far to the side did I get you good

just like keep on walking in and out of cha trying to help me out but you know this is what you do oh no if we do this you're not allowed to help me you're not allowed to guide me a nonstick frying pan and placed on a medium heat as the pan comes to a temperature and the salmon begins to sizzle about three minutes maybe I'm secretly test being tested and I meant to prep the dessert first I bet you I bet you have to prep the dessert before that takes longer this takes 30 minutes yeah we're going in mum and dad have got a gin and tonic oh no mum and dad are in the other room both got a gin and tonic watching some TV and chillin and I'm gonna get prepping because it's still pretty early it's quarter past 6:00 I'm gonna get prepping and fully make the dessert and leave it like to cool down and nicer than the fridge I think that's what I meant to junior my face I might call Jamie and see whether they leaving it in the fridge okay thing to do because it doesn't say iconic but it also doesn't say a cat and then after that's done which will be in about half an hour's time and then gonna make the salmon main course I've got to simmer the cherries and their syrup in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat until thick and then remove I've got the nonstick frying pan here the cherries are thickening apparently and now I need to remove this because it's all melted and leave it to cool for 10 minutes smells incredible this is where I don't know what to do whip the cream to very soft peaks have no idea what that means I'm calling Jamie to see if he can help me he's probably cooking his own dinner he probably isn't there to help come on good I'm available I don't know what to skip because where are you and I need you day me let's see what my cherries are doing let's see if these are thickening I'm just gonna start whisking I'm trying to make a soft peak no help mum know how soft peaks everybody separate the eggs and the yolks to the cream with the sugar yolks to the cream and the sugar now to my favorite bit the whisk so apparently apparently when your egg whites are super stiff you can tip the bowl upside down and it doesn't fall our fold the cooled chocolate into the cream then gently fold that through the egg whites I am making mum and dad the cherry chocolate mousse but I need your help with the yeah and then doing this folder no your words of wisdom yeah as much as the air but properly okay okay it looks good man it looks really good yeah I'm gonna need four nice little glasses yeah I've already done that beer that's just waiting on the side okay and then can I work in the fridge afterwards because I haven't cooked for the main course I'm doing the chorizo salmon so I'm courting love that ready but I haven't cooked any Vic's it only takes like ten minutes yeah so I thought I'd do this first because honestly I've been looking at the salmon recipe and you have to do two or three things at once and I'm not used to that okay okay I loved it my favorite bit of the book so far is that when I mean when I'm in the earlier shopping in the supermarket I can't forget any ingredients because there's only five so you've got miss anything out so all like to do is get ten things and I knew that I hadn't missed anything because I was doing two dishes this is you know Zoey said to me Ernie I need to go food shopping today and I said well wait just take this book keep it in the car that's what you want to do yeah that's a good idea is my aunt meant to feel like it's gonna fall off oh it actually looks really really good man I know and now I'm not very good that's normally when Zoey comes in but Zoey's not here I will down with our face Tommy you later on one when we're eating we can you can see what it looks like okay all right thanks man like innovate by legit don't know what I would have done if you didn't tell me how to fold by that's actually worked a miracle turning with one hand folding with other that is the key I've got to make it look good and as Jamie just said to me don't get it like spilt down the edges I honestly think Jamie's going to be proud of me smokey chorizo salmon for the ingredients if you've been watching the blogs for a while you will know that salmon is probably my favorite food like chicken and then salmon or salmon than chicken cooking it for three minutes like this then turn it over for five minutes then add in the treat so in for two minutes and then for an extra 30 seconds I'm throwing in all of the chopped up tomato smarter Little Mix the little salad god I just realized that moment that don't have an extractor fan so I've smoked out the whole of their kitchen I don't know if you can see but to open it all the back doors and all the windows and everything dinner's gonna be ready in seconds mum and dad are literally watching Jamie right now oh wow I made a spare one just because I just doubled the quantities dad get your button here I didn't make any for you sorry about that so we got basil tomato treats Oh olives oh yeah and salmon I've never thought but intreat sir and salmon together and I cook salmon all the time do you know what you've done really well as well I normally cut the skin off oh you eating the skin hello mate do you want some we've got a spare plate if you want some oh you never knew no no no so this is a oneoff then or things like these weekly oh they should be it local is happening I haven't even finished mine yet and these guys are already half in the other one because I just need to make sure update mom's just telling me you saw yesterday's blog I'm

this afternoon like makebelieving six o'clock so myself and all the people that are saying one thing boat we're going on the lead boat to move from here to the first island and then I will show you it an unpacked later which has thrown me off a little bit alive because I like to get unpacked and settled in you know like when you come to a hotel room and you unpack your things I'll I do anyway that's okay we'd rather have a boat that works and others want to get sail in now and I'm still in my travel stuff so I'm in my leggings and top and black leggings was such a real arrow honey get change party is basically the start of organizing people onto the boat or on the lead boat now and we are set to sail soon the met sailors in a skipper sailing holiday so we have met off get these names Brunel introduce you to them when the time is right and you can either hire a whole boat with all your friends to yourselves use about eight of you or you can come solo or in a couple or so off the I'm on my own we have a couple to actually fellow youtubers there called flying the nest energy running them below and then we have four girls from New Zealand so I'm still learning the names that

coming in that we've had overnight and it's still kind of happening it's a windy outside but this kind of threw everybody off course because we didn't do kind of the welcoming open party things reenact forgotten me the other girls and Steven then you see as you know a boat had some sort of mechanical technical engine issue of some description and this was going on a catamaran three different types of boats here there's a premium boat premium class and a captain manner because we have a catamaran it was quite a niche but I guess if not those of these ones they have to have another one sent to our Bay the original becoming about six o'clock and it didn't end up coming into the liner until about midnight because of a storm as well must have been so hard to sail the boat here I have only had like three or four hours sleep on and off we missed all my luggage settled into our cabins is a lot more spacious than Greece last year I really really bring me wind a little boat on I'll show you around okay so it's very windy so I'll do my best to shake wraps and I have so good music Oh something for the good this is the top area it's so windy though do you want to say good morning good

there's somebody's birthday on the Brazilian boat we have perfectly and we have to use that little thingie the lipstick for some food oh my gosh it doesn't raise you justice on camera this is so pretty I love it so easy in a cute little plane that is making a table for us in here just so sweet that is what you call a pizza like this a feud that's what the restaurant is called preferring the cterminus I'm just cutting play little cabin I don't know the time is I was very helpful twelve o'clock too late and I just had such a great evening with another boat well you guys know by now I think I've met this girl Emily cut along to ensure she was the taxi on the way to the airport with me she's also soloed the only other solo travelers of the English so we like me literally got and say well

Airport bathroom we don't have power because we're in like a what you saw it looks like when their power of asleep I wasn't suppose that I associated with all the people have both okay and a stone knives are so fun yeah we hung on we didn't go to dinner until quite late when you finished dinner about 10 what and the camera got on the ice cream and then we got on the boat came back we played you know and then we played the game where everyone is sat around and you each say a word and it creates a story which is really funny like I know it doesn't sound it but like times like now is how I define med sailor plane is our final night tomorrow is gone so quickly really really quickly actually I'm looking forward to going home and seeing Venky just wish I could live in a little trouble bubble and just meet people and hang out metal a system is or something I've ever done it's very very different like I think I need to talk about this more one and time but it feels this trip feels very different but equally good gets bad I will see tomorrow for our last full day and night then try does it work I mean is that anything after I'm waking up and moving like hawks anything that almost goodness Wow lots of you to make up to give morning Stan give Howie yeah oh my god I'm saying I'm going to get Michael to come back okay okay I got to spend all which lies in it leaving a book between 5:00 and 9:00 and we now or whenever something in a little beige break when of course forward so bad smells like black thing good brunette makes the most amazing tuna salad eating cucumber and sweet I'm thinking we've arrived in hvar because of the boat or moored up next to each other about the last ones on the end Emily and I are off to loo because it's much nicer going on land right and then we're going to going to get some trick like mixers for our drink place huh the boys on Emily but I've already got some ice which is good we are very prepared for a good night out we've had it's good so praline is a little bar called hulahula which is good to watch the sunset usually well the cricket is that cricket uhhuh quite possibly they're very loud we're going to go for burgers tonight we're just going to have a bit of a blowout for our last notes and fun yes yeah we're also going to go down to the little beach so bit sunbathing calling me some more Sun cream and I'm wearing my crew

five o'clock and we're just having free drinks I am dressed and ready I'm just going to sort my hat and little bit so just go out the shower but I'm wearing these cute little shorts I've got palm trees on them from Zara a little pry marks top but tonight I'm jumping over to another boat and it's nothing against my go it's just I'm going on quite well with any other guests I think being solo definitely one of the advantages is that you can like mingle I don't know I think and when you come with power you end up getting quite close to just your boat not really expanding the horizons in San Jose lingering I guess and I get on really well the cock with Emily as you know and so I like to spend as much time as I can with her so when I'm eating and drinking with her boat tonight she has a great gray boat of great people and fun animal on Instagram women taking pitching staff is really science one of the boys on the other boat has made a Mohito like punch bowl thing so we're going to be

"yes_Daily Vlog Homesense Haulin'  anothergirlslife AD.txt"	"oh god I got bags under my eyes probably good morning darlings so I'm really excited about this job today because I'm working with HomeSense and I thought I would do like a realtime whole / vlog type thing I've seen a few of these kinds of videos floating around flood force doesn't all the time and I really enjoy watching them so I thought hey let's do that with this so since I moved into my flat I've bought like the essential things that I need here in there but there's loads of other things that I've just never got around to buying so when home sets approach me to work than one this video I was like oh my god this is great because now I can get all the little bits that I need that I just haven't got around to getting because I feel like almost two years now and there's just still like bits and pieces like you know I mean when you move somewhere you never quite slipped it out if you've not heard a coma since I'm sure most of you have if you haven't there's there like a big brand I think they have them in the States as well but they're quite a big homo brand and I didn't realize that part of TK Maxx so if you like TK Maxx home I've got one really near to me a TK Maxx home and it's amazing so they're not a brand they're just a store and they basically like buying home where stuff like all year round it's all different brands so they have they're really good for like quite actually kind of oneoff pieces like big pieces like a chair or like a statue or a big pot you know like those kind of oneoff like statement things that you want in your house but you can also get like everyday stuff like glasses place kitchenware duvet covers all that kind of stuff it's really good quality stuff as well as being like discounted which is amazing especially for home where so saying that when you're in somewhere like home since it's one of those places where if you see something you have to get it there and then because they're not going to have loads of it it's going to be either a oneoff or only a few of that item because of the way that they buy so it's very much if you go there and you see something you like just get it because you probably won't get it and I went there ages ago and I did see this chair but it was like 300 pounds so I didn't get it kind of how can they still have that so yeah I'm up right now Tony I was going to try and drag Hannes he's come with me but he's not interesting doesn't care home stuff which is fine I'm gonna go off to my I say my local home sets it's still quite a bit of a drive and see what I can get there's a few key things I do need to get like bed linen and maybe like a throw for the sofa because I think now especially being September it's like a really good time to it's almost like the opposite of a spring clean isn't it like getting your house ready for the cold months I love doing that so yeah maybe some nice throws some new Christian covers things like that so let's start the voyage to home scents and I'll see you when I get there fingers crossed the traffic's not too bad so I've been exchanged in slight change of plan so we have actually one movie with us now I have trouble getting here so he drove me here and I've also changed my top because it's so hot it's such a nice day I just have to clear up guys roses I have chicken legs my resent actually because I think I've got great legs but she says because I've got big thighs and the blob on this bottom bit meant to be skinnier than entire though he's got lovely legs look at them he's got chicken are we gonna be teaching kids how to cook nice my arms are huge it's a full basket the basket is full Mary look at I grin I am NOT starving we are home from home sent home from home sense and then going to have dinner behind me this is all the stuff that I bought from Home sense and I'm gonna sit down on my bed and show you everything so it's kind of like a very informal hall let me put you on my tripod at least okay can you see me is this okay right so let's start with like the bitty things cuz I got a few big pieces but we'll leave them to laughs and just start one like the bitty kind of random stuff those things that I wasn't even in the market for that I was like it's so cheap I just have to I could not resist so we'll start off with something very boring and mundane coat hangers can never have too many coat hangers these are kind of velvety ones these are more for hainsley these are a little bit too wide probably for my clothes but we've got them because you can also hang Charles's as well as jackets and tops so you can get more on one hand basically flannels you can never have too many flannels in my opinion this thing needs unwrapped I got a couple of little bowls I used to have balls like these and then I think I moved out of the place that I bought them in and just left them there so I got a couple more because they're really good for kind of soup and noodles and things like that I just really like the pattern of these so this was only 399 and it's getting into winter it's really good for like stews and stuff then I got a smaller Bowl which is good for like dipping sauces so if you're having sushi or like dumplings or anything and that was $2.99 again I really like the pattern of it it's got a different one on the outside and it has inside I really loved this kind of asianinspired China well China where is that we cool it okay what's next onto the bigger things and we bought a new pillow this is actually for home to me it's very particular about his pillows so we've picked him up a new one this would have been fifty pounds but I got it for $24.99 how good is that then we have more bedding I bought this was just to do makeup it's not the pattern was quite nice this would have been 249 pounds and it was first no 99 I can't really argue with that and you can see it's got a pattern on it but it's not to like anything too garish I suppose in the bedroom I like quite plain bedding but I thought this is a really nice option this recycled glass bars I thought this was really nice this was $7.99 and I thought I might put it in the bathroom and try and get a really big like palm to put in it cuz I thought that would look really nice in there I also bought this planter which was $7.99 I'm very into houseplants I thought this one was really nice I really like the pattern on it because it's got this kind of a it's not a statement but it's got a pattern on it but it's not to like garish okay this is gonna be quite difficult to show this is for the bathroom I thought it was really cute my boss is quite small but I thought there would be a space for this kind of next to the toilet and you could just put little bits and bobs in there like cotton wall it's just a really good way to store things but it's quite compact this isn't odd price it would have been 83 74 but it's $24.99 and then lastly this is the thing I'm most excited about one of these crochet poops I've seen these on Pinterest and Instagram on all the home accounts I follow every one every one for ages and I'm so excited when I saw it because it's just watch and it was $49.99 but doesn't say what the price it would have been but I know that these are pretty expensive if it's not clear what it is it's a footstool but this is what's good about home since it's got these kind of but as you can see like everyday things and then there is some kind of really unique like standout pieces now I've got the task of putting all this stuff away so I've unpacked my knives don't they look fancy that's about all I've managed to do I have poured myself a glass of wine and they're out now it's quite late it's like 9 o'clock so I'm just going to sit on the safer with me be know we'll probably sign off this book now won't we I think you should so I hope you've enjoyed this kind of like funny realtime vlog hole type thing I'll link

"yes_DECORATING MY APARTMENT WITH DESENIO  MOVING VLOG #4  AD.txt"	"good morning angels welcome back to my YouTube channel and welcome to another day in the life saga of Ellen the Jane Darby and Connor pulls left in their new apartment it's currently about o'clock in the morning this morning I've been editing my autumn clothing haul if you haven't seen that yet the link is in description box below make sure you go and watch it I've given the house a brief tidy but I need to film is run now and do that my main focus this morning is getting these beauties first I partnered with to send out this video and if you don't know about to send you know they're basically like an amazing really well Fry's salih art sort of company my sisters sometimes work with them before and I just literally love their stuff so much so I picked out some stuff that I wanted I'm gonna hang up on the walls let me show you guys now actually which ones I've got think you guys will love them oh this is all the stuff that's going up on the wall in our living room basically under Sonya's actual website they have like ass calorie wall info section where you can actually pick like different styles gallery walls obviously if you just get loads of pictures this is a very adult thing I noticed when I was them trying to do like this it's so hard to try and put together a good combination of all the different stuff but luckily they have a really good section on the website where it like gives you ideas for different coloring types the first one I picked up was this big one this is a 50 by 7 foot print and it's just a pink perfume bottle the next big one I picked up with this is also assisted by 70 this one this is a pink flamingo and then it has a really nice quote at the bottom of it which I really love it says reflection attract what you expect reflect what you desire become what you respect and mirror what you admire and I got to 30 by 40 ones and these are the ones I'm going to go for in the living room this one says Coco I don't do fashion I am fashion because that's just me boo I picked this one because I just thought that is so amazing how nice is that says vacation mode on and like pink neon writing against a grey wall that was so nice and then I picked up these two small ones for the 21 by 30s I picked up this one which says live your dream I thought that was so nice and this one which is pink and it says simplicity in gold writing so they're gonna go up on my living room wall right there and then I pick up some other ones as well which are gonna go into other rooms which I'll show you quickly but I also picked up two more big ones which is I'd probably like my favorite prints out of all of them you guys the first one is this amazing one I don't know I think it's like a like a beach or an island or something but it's got some really nice tones on it there's like pink and gray which is what my home is you guys know that by now and then this one to go next to it it says relax and the L is all funky and upside down I'm gonna put those two next to each other and I really want to put them in our bedroom because I think that's you know calming I think it's a nice thing to have in a bedroom my issue is I forgot to buy another 50 by frames where can I put this one's upstate which I'm so annoyed about but next time I go to Ikea and I'm definitely gonna get another 50 by for him so I can put them up in the bedroom I'm gonna put these ones up in my Beauty room this is like a gold map of the world and it said and I think to myself what a wonderful world which is just one of my favorite songs ever I think it's so nice and I'm gonna put that one next to this one which is a pink zebra print and then the last one I bought was this one I was just obsessed with this I saw there's no like oh my god I've got to have that in my star sign is the Sagittarius star sign there's such Terrace November 22nd to December 21st fYI my birthday is December the night from 22 this year boo of curiosity for the unknown which is so so mean they have them to every star sign I was gonna get Collins as well by thought I just you know I mean the bedroom is a work in progress so today I'm gonna focus on the living room and beauty room ones and I'm gonna hang those up right now so as you guys can see this is directly above our sofa and this is the sort of like inspo idea that I was telling you guys about senio on the website have an actual guide how to hang wall print so last night Connor was being my handyman for me and honey's all up and then these are the two in the Beauty room that I'm gonna do just because that's a really nice place to put them you know that wall is kind of empty and over on this wall I'm going to be putting shelves up also thinking about putting the Knab and I thought the doors gonna shark can't see them this New York painting that kind of bought me is going to go probably above that so really the only place I could probably fit them think I look cute there though I do actually have a to dicenio for this video and I have a discount code as well which I believe is just le e ll e and that gives you 25% off all the posters but honestly really recommend guys just going and have a look because I was in love with all of their posters and telling me that right now I feel like such an adult talking about this I've been excited to get these posts up for weeks now I've had them for so long oh let's get them up oh my god are you obsessed because I am how incredible does that look oh my god really underestimated how much of a difference that was gonna make I love it I'm absolutely in love with that now I'm gonna quickly go and do the ones in the Beauty room oh how amazing is that even those two make such a difference to the room do you know what I mean like it just it just makes it look a bit more full oh I love it so much okay so I've just popped up the Sagittarius one in the frame that when I decide where I actually want to put it I can just put it straight up I have a spare little one now I don't know really why I've got that one then this is one of the frames that it's gonna be used in the bedroom but I need to buy another one so I'm really looking forward to getting those up because I just didn't I didn't realize how much the prints would actually make a difference do you know I mean like I just think that completely adds to my living room the only things I think I want to do to my living room to maybe get a small desk to put over here I just think that corner is like a bit bare I need something there I need to get some candles in these lanterns I need to put this LED light up on the bottom of the shelf and this is gonna be the Christmas corner so in here I'm gonna put my Christmas tree and stuff other than that I mean obviously it's really messy at the moment but my lounge is really coming together those prints are just everything I love them so much don't forget that

day and the rest of my family are coming up to lunch now I think my parents stayin here where we stayed tonight it's so nice having a long weekend and also it's so good for vlogging because I've logged on Friday and I have a day off and then I drop today and then I get another day off tomorrow it doesn't feel like I've blocked the whole weekend yeah you've done it wrong again when I go and then put over pinch it put over and under yes Oh nearly pinch it under over keep hugging tight nearly okay mommy she knows how to do that in a minute okay maybe I'm not doing real fulfillment me do my makeup because Bailey was paid cuts cradle six enriches getting dressed in the background I'll see you in a minute I've kind of locked myself in the bathroom so that I can do my hair yeah I'm gonna straighten my hair and then put in some nice wave because I like how they am like drop out throughout the day knowing me I always have to straighten my hair first because I always wake up with slightly curly hair also I struggle to do my hair without watch the video that's on a decision we were dancing on quite a record okay even right here it's done straightened it and I put some waves in it and I'm actually not going to show you guys this product because Batista sponsoring this video very kindly of them and they have this called you put on that they sent me I gave it go and I really liked it it is there to in one invisible dry shampoo and conditioner it says 18 our conditioning and this is the Coco and Kashmir sense you've probably heard of their dry shampoo I think Petit Latif that pretty much known for their dry shampoo but this is a bit different it's not a product that you can spray in the roots to get rid of grease it's something you spray in like the mid to end length of your hair and it's a dry conditioner I've used to dry conditioner before and I really like them because I can't use like a wet conditioning spray on my hair once it's done because why my hair gets wet it will be straight anymore it'll go curly so I love dry conditioners and I've got quite like thick textured coarse hair so this really softens the hair I love I love having like soft hair something I've always wanted and I'll younger I'm going to show you how to use this I like to shake it up and then from about here I just spray it all over the hair and then I brush it through in the hands I can't like brush my hair with a brush words is like this because it just goes really frizzy but I brush it through in my hands it smells really nice love might be sat by a fire and so my freshly washed hair now kind of smells like fire so the smell of this the Coco and Kashmir it's really nice it makes my hair feel so soft and like in such good condition I'm a big fan of this party they have a mini sized as well I haven't managed to find one yet I would probably get the mini and keep it in my handbag and use it as like an onthego things freshen up my hair throughout the day I'm going to get rich to come in and take a nice photo of me using this fit Instagram so if you want to use it more as the shampoo again spray it from that far away but then you just like massage it into the root I like to use it more than mid to end length but you can the whole point is it's a shampoo and conditioner so you can massage it into the roots as well just so it's very really close up let's get on with the day right that Instagram about 45 minutes maybe being rich nearly killed me I was so bad making him help me on a weekend I think the kids are outside playing rugby and surges here about to pop can it do that movie thing again excuse me you thought that stage we have puts like his elbows through his stomach and it's really freaky all right in this cute little song shop I'm around here it would probably be close Lee since we're going to have vegetable lunch slight problem though my dad is stuck my parents have an electric car and they they works out like the mileage is to get here and it was absolutely fine it was a petrol station that had like a charger they just got the deflation and the charge is not working so they can't charge the car and they've got ten miles left so we're we're not really sure what's going to happen hopefully they're going to make it but in the meantime we're going shopping sorry mmm mince pies you can get cute or basket assholes there's a whole freezer full of possums and planet replies that you actually cook in the office these colors in honey color info is amazing I'll come back to the house and we're going to play it off the main game of Scrabble which I don't think I've ever actually played forever like now I'm getting really bad at this but we are on our way home we left the craziness in that house all the kids like Athanasius things in the door and it was all a bit mental we're now heading back upstream reading some comments from my video that went up today which was like how to incorporate more color into a wardrobe and a little haul our link our communities hasn't seen it yet just want to say thanks for all your lovely comments I've noticed since I got back from South Africa I did that let's catch up

know a lot of you guys want to see that so I will try to do that a lot more in the near future slug is going to be quite interesting because I am going to be showing you guys the behind the scenes of the element collection if you don't know what the element collection is where have you been for the past few days it's my new hedger collection that I released on my website and you're going to love it if you haven't seen already you will love it I've also got a promo video on my youtube channel to watch my I think it was two videos ago um I am so humbled by the response I've got from this collection you guys have been so supportive every season celebrating his collection with me and I absolutely love the fact that everybody's coming together on this I absolutely love the fact that people are appreciating my creativity I know I completely understand what people don't really get it because some people don't understand creativity and that's absolutely fine but I love the fact that so many people came out to support me it's how many people voiced their support and everything all social media which is brilliant and I love seeing that other than showing you guys the enemy connection today is gonna be quite as a day me and my intern are working on packaging orders to get into you as soon as possible and also I can't wait to use this wrong facial that I've been using recently and I absolutely love it such a good idea by the way I'll show you guys all about it abate I know you guys all want to see what I do for my skin I'm going to show you guys a little instudio facial at the end of the video so make sure you stay into that because honestly the weather the past few days has been absolutely disgusting my skin feels so gunky and like oily and my paws feel so clogged so I just can't wait to use something for my skin I'm not been taking care of my skin that much for the past few days because I've been so busy with this election but today I'm going to take some time off during my work and get my skin feeling fresh out further ado I'm going to be showing you this element collection behind the scenes I went to the most amazing team on this campaign and I can't wait for you guys to see how it will happen and I can't wait to do some more work with these people they're honestly so talented I'm so grateful for them and I hope you guys enjoy the clips I hope you enjoy the rest of the vlog make sure you keep watching to the rest of the vlog see my facial and make sure you keep watching to see the behind the scenes at the element collection so way back here and I just went ran off to do a few errands and we're still working on the orders well Hipparchus working on the waters I've been running errands and so far we've done packaged all of these still got lots of orders to go through I'm gonna I'm tryna send as much as I can tomorrow so that some of you guys receive them before I eat okay so yeah which we're working really hard on this this is the perfume were using on all orders these are the ones today there's about 35 or 36 packages here so I'm gonna do that right now these are some packages are ready to be filled with scarf these are all the scars we have at the moment but yeah I'm gonna do that now so hopefully you guys will get you ordered before a lot of people first get they what is blade hey guys so it's the end of the day I've kind of changed my scarf again I feel like I've chained my stuff today so many times and I'm feeling super exhausted and tired I am oily and gunky and horrible and the weather's been really horrible today so I'm gonna give myself a little instudio facial using the born face spa I recently started using this and I absolutely love it guys should definitely get hold of this as I hate gift or bet they give to someone you love it's coming up so soon so this is like the perfect gift especially someone who spends a lot of money to go and get all off they shovels the best part of it is you can do wherever you want I'm doing in my studio out I also do at home sometimes I love how compact and small it is I can just travel with it wherever I want so of course my skin is completely clean I'm just going to show you quickly what comes in this little bag the device comes with an epilating attachment it also comes with two other attachments such as the cleansing attachment and a massaging attachment which looks like this I'm gonna start by cleansing my skin because obviously I have all this grubby stuff on my skin which I'm not happy with right now so I'm gonna go on down to my skin and I'll be right back so I'm gonna put on this attachment which allows muting to change between the cleanser attachment and the massage attachment cleansing with the machine is actually like six times better than cleansing your fingers on the cleanser I'm using today is something a little bit harsher than normal than a gentle cleanser that I would usually use this is the Mourad AVH ehh exfoliating cleanser like that I'm going to go and wash my face and quickly come back I'm going to take off the cleansing head and I'm going to put on the massaging hair to the massage extension I'm just going to add another small dollop of the Murad cleanser this attachment really helps with tightening the skin on my face feels so good after that massage this removes four times the amount of hair that a normal waxing does so that's the end of the day for me I hope you guys enjoyed spending the day with me and seeing what I get up to I am Supergirl so I'm usually going to go home and sleep like a baby today and let me know if you'd like to see more vlogs like this thank you guys so much for watching and supporting and I'll see you guys in my next video bye"	1253
"yes_ENGLAND VS RUSSIA - EURO 2016 MATCH VLOG DIER FREE KICK, LATE GOAL & FAN TROUBLE"	"so much and many fees reduce you must reduce it who is hot enough for that nonsense all right mate how you doing welcome back to another video today I'm in a hotel room yes why because I'm in Marseille for the blood the Euro match England's first game against Russia I'm here with Carlsberg they've kindly invited me and say we've got another hotel room will be hooking up with him in a minute to come out here for this game all I am pumped this is a competitive game at tournament Euro I've only seen one competitive England game at a tournament before there was ten years ago in the World Cup 2006 in Germany I was there said was there my brother Saunders and over there we saw England lose on penalties to Portugal in the quarterfinal we do not want to see us lose today obviously it can't go to penalties it's a group game but I'm confident we'll get the wind today I'm confident we'll get some goals today on pump we're going to go to Marseilles we're going to spin a few hours before the game getting amongst it of course and then we're going to the match we've got my England shirt here with me of course I can't actually wear it to the game which is a bit of a shame because it's a strict dress code we're going to like upper echelon you know part of way of watching the game which is great obviously but comedy England shirt as a result but England is in my heart come on let's get a big result let's go get them here he is snapchat so bboy sad chat guys um we really all shopping more want me yes decent me us you I can find some food a food review oh yes mate food review and watch the errant whistling game seriously game has kicked off it's going fine mister what needs to go mister go away miss fabian shark trying to find sides or support ball the problem is it doesn't seem to be anywhere really like a shopping centre thing and there's a lots of restaurants sure but no football and I don't like missing any football last two tournaments I'm watched every single game woke up and the last euros I'm already missing Twitter and Albania aka Albania vs. Albania bteam well Slovakia is next I want to miss that but we're struggling I'm struggling so it fell somewhere to eat and the better news is we've got the total one rad come on one nil to Switzerland right now i ban you dance ten minute NBD a stinker didn't they bog out drinks way to see sips it was actually a desert on the dessert menu when in Marseille do as the Marseillaise do it Jimmy does Timmy let's talk about that to meet you poet you should play from our site this is the city that made him in many ways he played father Cubs before that course but I'm pretty sure he's happily after training every day I think that would explain a lot I mean me and Davey you know Jimmy's been taking the world on the hashtag free kick taker you know there's a lot of similarities no no except you need a food review from you please oh well as they say in France it's dis one D saw you ready Jason reopener spend Oh get up where you got can you deal with that I don't know we're always sure my oh yeah blowing literally just the one right on the coach we better head off to the England game semi hell are you gauging out it's getting closer now I smell the grass now are we gonna win this game this question I do feel we're gonna win this game I do I'm realistic I feel I gonna win I feel we gonna win it let's do it oh that is bad we're good to meet you boys okay guys we got off the bus cause the traffic is insane but doesn't look insane there but there is cars there there's no because she was taking us about 40 minutes to go about a third of a mile I think we've got a couple miles to wall we're still going to get to the game in time I'm sure but it's bit stressful there's a lot of people about God monsters growing office or violence between fans so we have to walk all through that to get to the game in time but the traffic was not working for us we're walking you know what guys you might be getting a little bit of sweat here might take a little bit longer this way but it's much nice we're seeing a little bit of Marseille what do you think local scenery sighs delightful they still like the birds are seen in the trees especially really peaceful this stuff about riot glorious what short though it was deceptively cold on that bus because of the aircon on and also by the pier having a few drinks early it was like really really breezy it was lovely but now we're down in the branch streets a bit one this is probably where the major part used to live when you play for Martin tells us there yeah that's what made him come on let's get this stadium to me okay we decided to start running it wouldn't be an authentic matchday blog from me and say but we didn't run to the game at some point I mean we've got plenty of time but part of these be readings go get a sweat on oh come on then we'll get there we'll get there we always do you can see where the fans have been can't you they leave their mark okay we're nearly there here we go there's the stadium you take a while the Katie imposter Curie he should be honey this is the boy this is the one that's come on please listen here we go here we go here we go decent Romanian plenty until I'm at the end 20 minutes before kickoff bodied up to start paint on his own 43 formation ok seems good enough to be a show we should be them let's do it come on England Oh he charted but still revenue ready for a real job sure rock okay so on both I think go walk away true diamond fire to get the go generalization like Oh well in nearly 20 minutes in the second half in a future is evil way to be honest the game needs a change I still finished only bonded no substitutions made yet don't think Spain should go off yeah putting into everyone like angry cat now for the law for a 30k 50 no disciple guru should technique never Russians are kicking off not ideal pay the world also made the defense interpretation pigpig all right we've drawn in Russia god now kick it off over there what's up time to go lads we have to wait for the nonsense to finish over there rushes the chasing some English people takes away from the football to be honest is disappointing to see the millions of Russians can see these they started frying flares about shit embarrassing for them and obviously when they scored the English bands were all so much grown happy either so basically in summary if you're kicking off in all the trouble out there English or Russian or whatever you're amongst all I can say that we don't beat Wales we're in trouble which is not a great situation to be in a grog replaces Avakian X hope you get win against them then going to Wales game feeling confident stayed Wales one earlier to one gets lucky they're going to come in feeling top of the world we're going to be annoyed about that result I don't know I just don't know there they go space Maroons it's minor fact because of logic people think they like Curt scoff call feeling their fan of Curt's concept the charge my gods just got back to the room after a long old day we just picked up some pizzas to a they drown our sorrows eat our sorrows obviously we drew the game it's not disaster when you're winning and you're dominating and you give it away in the last minute it always feels bad so is this a negative vibe right now in the camp when you say so definitely negative vibe it's not nice I mean being completely give a story if Russia had played well we've got the last winner would fill or the last equalize would feel buzzed it but they robbed us those celebrating in like they've robbed something it feels that way but I will say this I hope in I want to be too negative because I do feel that we did play very well I feel that football could do some cool things we can easily say eyes England all over again but let's just put it aside for now we beat Wales and I'll take the two games start yeah well that's the key thing play from this if it wasn't crucial ready England Wales is huge we win it we're going to win the group we lose it when want will go through if we don't get out this group it will be the one of the worst things we've ever done because even third place is a challenging day out the group this time so let's not even think about that stay positive play like we did today which take our chances maybe make some slight changes I'd like to maybe see I'm glad to see body start maybe for Kane maybe is a part of a front free sterling looks lively we didn't have any product for me I wouldn't start him people send daily I didn't play well tonight I still think he's in our best team Delhi Ali plays but maybe he needs to come out the limelight for a game keep him hungry well I think we all sure looks good you know I was a bit against Wilshire being on the plane of us because he hadn't played but the fact is he's here and when he's playing he's looking good he's one of our better players when fit stick him in stick him in why not I don't know we'll see what the team selection ends up with but we just need to beat Wales we beat Wales it's going to be epic I'm going to be there Sims going to be there Carlsberg is taking us to that one as well big thanks to cars will go for giving us this experience sir shame we didn't get a win but it's been decent and hopefully this food / pizza will be decent as well see you on the next one until then don't go change bye bye you"	1975
"yes_Exploring Bristol"	"hello pal happy Sunday morning or at least it is as I record this this is my look this is a good look today I have something a little bit different today I'm working with grapes Western Railways which is a train service here in the UK the south west of the UK and we are kind of teaming up to celebrate World Book Day I'm editing this another day and realized that I said National Book Day well done Hayley I think one of the best things about living in the UK and one of my favorite things about the UK is the accessibility offered by train when I was young there was a train that would go through my town that I never really got to ride on but we used to count the train cars there just this thing that I saw never come near and then I'm flipside that you had the fantastical trains here the Hogwarts Express and you had the train I got the peasants Iza the Blitz and the professor's house where I found Narnia so transport we're almost mythic in my mind when I moved to the UK a few years back I used to be going up and down to Edinburgh every few weeks and that's when I just really fell in love with trains okay before I keep talking about trains let me finish curling my hair and let's get on a bus that will do not only is it a more sustainable way of travel as compared to planes or cars or anything like that I love taking a few hours just sit and relax and look out the window and read a book and feel like you're actually getting somewhere because you literally are coming back to the UK about a year ago I've made it my mission see as much as the UK as possible because it's so easy to just look at a kit online usually a few weeks in advance I think at Great Western Railways you can look up to 12 weeks in advance and it's really cheap and then you can just go see a new city and come home at the end of the day and sleep in your own bed its opponent it's a form of travel it's basically only second best to apparition in my opinion webinar with morning everybody sings I like it better very Rocky during the monitoring out because I'm on my way to Bristol Sabine bookshops change in all of the countries and they are a free return to get to escape the novel machine chain city like I'm doing right now if they treasure hunt in the milk and drink so and on what more could you tell highways hi Bobby my favorite contagious fiction successes in the comments now and then see you later what look behind us in case you're wondering what might rain read is today I am reading between the world and me by Tom Ahoskie coat also Black History Month in the u.s. so finally getting around to reading this one we didn't Stockholm by oh I really hope you can hear man it's not too windy here on the water should be perfectly honest for a very long time I'm mostly a so disassociated result with this so it was kind of where Harry fell asleep and I also I'm pretty sure that Bristol is where JK Rowling was originally from or near by bursts or something like that and also where she got to poop longer Harry Potter knowledge so film healthy donors years I have learned that bristle is actually a really creative environment like it's a home to a lot of series at mysteries and just really awesome Alta it's beautiful and it's on water which makes me feel like I'm at home since my home town was a little fairy town so the first thing I've done today is check out the Arnolfini which is like a museum also I've marked a lot of places I really want to do so on your wrist so let's do that does this give you guys as many Diagon Alley vibes as it's giving me also it's called the Christmas stuff so you know my kind of place but nevertheless people just did must to find more indie shops I went into a really cool shop called Lane that sold a lot of cool art like local crafts and things like that very cool picked up gifts for my brother's I can't say because you might watch me birthdays in April my book in the last book shops you can't receive because it's all covered by scaffolding but it really was also a hit and I also sold old covers of different magazines such and I got this vogue for 5 pounds and I think it is so cool so it's been a little while since I checked in closely just because I've been popping in and s and shops and stuff as I go and now on my way over to a stationary shop that I want to go to and then my Clifton suspension bridge which everyone has told me to do so I got a bus pass today about a person walking works it's probably a very windy I just wandered around the Clifton arcade which is such a small independent shop and they were really really cool if you're in Bristol I super recommend going there they had a really cool I'm stationary shop called paper Smith had been week I got really overwhelmed for the amount of cool stationary I ended up not getting anything fudge as you guys have seen I've taken you to a few different book shop went to the last book store we went to Stanford's which was the travel book store as well as the art museum book shops that I went to as soon as I got to Bristol so we've been to a few independent booking up and I don't have my ticket here what I'm going to do is go back to one of those three book shop place it in one of my favorite escapist books maybe I'll give you a hint later as to what book it is but I think you guys might be able to guess and then anyone who watches this from Bristol can go find it and get your own little escape alright guys like a lovely cream tea at the tea we'll see room here in Bristol I hid the ticket earlier I also popped into the museum for a bit but I want to film America's museums are weird about that obviously all right police month heading back on station now Bristol cleared because it feels like three different cities at once you have some old areas in some newer areas and they're all loosely connected it mixes the old and new in a very different way than say like Edinburgh really stark contrast here it fades in and out of old and new I don't know how to explain it but it's really impressed okay I thought slightly more about what I think I'm saying about the flowing in and out is that you can feel every decade here if you can feel all the countries in decades at the city center oh my god and just like that it is the end of my day here at work so I'm sorry to anyone who came here looking for like a step by step what you should do while you're in Bristol video or something I when I go to the city for just again typically to live to do you know we just kind of go in and out of stuff hang out wander messages I had a really wonderful day I hit my ticket I'll give you a little sneak peek cut actors kind of big sneak peek because no matter you know what look at it is right here it's in an indie bookstore here in Brazil so one of you guys can go out and find it if you live in Brazil and attended to just relax on the train and start editing this video actually probably thank you to Great

hotel in Brooklyn and I've got this big old window here and I've got blinds which pull down but you know what I'm gonna leave them open the entire time because it is so amazing last night when I got in it was pitch black and obviously all the lights are on it just looks stunning so let me show you Mike the skyline I've got everything I can see the Empire State Building I can see the Chrysler Building I can see he knew One World Trade building over there in the corner and when it's nighttime it looks amazing so last night I slept with the window with a blind open because I'm jetlagged I woke up that quite early and I saw the Sun comes up over that way but it's amazing because it will reflect the lights of the windows of the buildings it's just made me very happy anyway the reason I'm in New York is because why I sell have launched their new men's fragrance called why now if you follow me on Instagram I actually was very lucky or given the fragrance I was one of the first people the entire world had given fragrance and I run a thing on my Instagram stories where people could request a sample and that was actually a real soul but I've got two models so the people who are watching me on Instagram stories could request a sample now is actually available in real life in August or so I put a link down there and I've made a mess of the tables once I got here I hope given a goodie bag with all sorts of stuff so I had the Instax camera and somewhere I had to go I've made a mess of everything I be smoothing out the way somewhere I have a lot of Polaroids up I was taking the time the stars with me but she's kind of here and it didn't capacity she's come along for fun while I'm doing you know the cool stuff and he might have all these little pony what you took here's the fragrance itself and here is the packaging it comes in it's very very nice actually like I said I've had it for like a month or two now so I've been kind of using it quite a lot and it is beautiful and the concept behind and while I are in New York is because it's basically about creative selfmade people who follow their drive and follow their dreams so I'm the only person here there's about three Brits well those two Brits and one Spaniard who lives in London so all of a Cheshire's here with me and diego who lives in London and but there's people from like literary all over the world so last night we got in and on the rooftop having a few drinks like a welcome thing and there's a lot of people here so I think this videos I mean those were fun very dynamic and we do some incredible things we're going on a helicopter ride and a Dodgers game like I'm a baseball stuff is gonna be amazing so I'm looking forward to this video come along let's hang out and let's do New York step one is what I think is gonna be like a really disgusting workout I'm here with Jess here Jaime hello Maya he's the fellow Brit on this journey and if you know Oliver Jesse follicle Instagram you'll know that one is very attractive to super buff so I said I'm gonna do his work out with him which yesterday says consists of cardio chinups was it situps yes and what we're out and pushups which are my my weak point a lot of our stuff so yeah we were walking to the gym and it's gonna get proper sweaty before all the day begins it's a very intense workout honestly feel a bit sick now and not all of us like me jog back to the hotel I hate him really hate it because this is important what we're talking about today one of the themes of how this whole thing's died and how why all his that was talking about passion I don't know if you guys and that's the group like I said there's a lot of us doing this so what you just saw then I just got a few seconds was a big talk about one about there's and mechanics or the fragrance I was in it was actually really interesting pretty hard to describe a fragrance Bertie way they thought the radiators it's not like wearing a crisp white shirt on the beach it's got kind of quite a classic quite crisp notes but in underneath this almost like the Sun says there where a crisp white shirt on the beach at sunset home or innocence II and actually now I've said that I can really clean up anyway the guy who was presenting here the host the whole thing was called mark and he hath knees in the first minute excited talking about it in like a film weighing about how a story so um as you know I'm writing a film and the way of stories told is well yeah it's pretty good to actually know a bit background behind it and now be able to describe the scent in a nice place good anyway now we're going to some place to get lunch and actually play with some I don't mean okay we're gonna place it at lunch and play with something to do with the I guess the ethos of the fragrance it's all about asking why and you know what what drives you to be creative and stuff and then I'm getting at the helicopter so that's cool so now we're in the fragrance experience part of a chair doing something with the VR is going to put on filming he's still right there mate not a clue not to click going over here we have like a gift station or gph I'm not sure to keep legit basically this properties taking lots of photos and then they get sent to us and we can post them we have like a flatmate all the accoutrements to make money there is a nice and it smells amazing in here though because it's 70 fragrances around everyone spraying it smells really fresh you might not be able to hear me because we currently on our way to get over to eat bad boys so the helicopter Rovers cool hey whether the Hulk's really where today it started up this morning it's 27 degrees now it's still humid but it's been raining and it's like really heavy and like gray and stuff anyway the the heading on is amazing then I had a quick interview in a car so cameras on me and without questions meaning that the empire communal like red and snow in the cloud and everything very very cool over this way I'll show it's big old wine it's like a photo booth tonight I think the motors which is a beer that looks yen for this flashing going on I'm really regressing my outfit today everyone so when I went for breakfast this morning it was bit chillier it was like 8:30 in the morning so the Sun hasn't quite you know fully risen and everything I looked at the weather forecast miss so does 27 degrees and I was like no way so I wore this jacket is actually quite heavy drink we've just been ages weighing in a corridor for do I gather the troops when the people ready here waiting for us looks so cool on the water and it's like reading rustic and very New York I'm all about this this guy here is gonna be our ride for a little while we're getting a ferry I don't

headquarters we can get lunch there apparently something to a pizza that's exciting oh hi everyone only at the Yankee Stadium so exciting that launched my first ever baseball game Kurt's going the journey and now I don't really know the rules of baseball we have rounders at home which is from what I understand a similar concept with a smaller bat but he's still gonna hit the board and he pulling around you know bases and stuff I'm so excited we've got like a hairy butt like a special booth where it's loads and loads of food and I'm going to buy a laser those of them March I want to get like a Yankees yeah sports games type thing and like food everywhere it comes with people actually making this food and look at him so honestly I'm so excited baseball I think I'm a spared you

batting but it's a smaller version so ice cream not for heads I run everyone here he comes taking his time as I was ready to basically he whacked it into the ground over there morning so I slept for like 11 hours last night they've got towards the end of the baseball game and I couldn't keep my eyes open cause I've been here now for like four days I think three next morning and every night we've been out we've stayed out loads a.m. and we've had clients drink and stuff and I just my body it couldn't handle it anymore without wood jetlag and everything I'm just so tired so I was kind of falling asleep during the bar during the basically game got back here just like slit but howlers i've been up for like two hours now and it's our final day and we don't have been really really cool we're going back in another helicopter but this time it's different because you get strapped into the helicopter and kind of hang out the side so you can get most of cool footage that's a great photos my brother did it when he was here a few months ago I said it's like one of the best things he ever did the issue is you know I'm talking about how great the viewers and everything look at the view today it is very very cloudy which is mist has come over Manhattan so you know the other day after to see everything right into Manhattan now I can't see anything like earlier it's getting better cuz earlier I couldn't even see those glories there those trucks I couldn't even see them before it was just complete whiteout so it is getting better and it's now like half eight in the morning when we're going up and headed up till about eleven ish so maybe or burner no I don't know either way cause be on a helicopter and hang on the side even you can't see anything cool let's do it I was bloody

bit hey this is pretty good considering a they're the youngest in the class would be the only starting reception and so I just mentioned Thank You Sun and hope they can give you guys some tips if you're looking up your kids at home and I'm calling a home school we're not really like exclusively homeschooling the toons they aren't going to go to like a regular school as well but there's definitely stuff we do at home especially Sam as well just to supplement their learning I feel that really important for your children at home if I can I'm rambling I'm gonna do just a few short bits so I'm gonna share with you how we do some reading writing and basic math I probably do a separate one for what we're doing Kayla yeah he's only one but he's doing a few activities as well with these cards so I've got quite a few here this has got very short words on them and that's how we start with reading just like you should call them flash of memory car yes sweetheart maybe your brother who's written on it your other brother your baby brother all right guys let's get started to do pick one that one I know you pick one oh you ready you ready good and what's that say good boy right living what you got for me what's that say okay all right which one is there number two that's the number two M's anyone know this one's a new one what's that good job so that's the first I'm going to show you so you can just use flash cards with them and just go through them those tunz tunz we're working suit okay next one is their memory verses so I've got them pretty much atoz again I'm just showing me the first view I live in which one do you want to do you wanna do is ready picture will you pick one which one do you want a new car alright and basically each letter so it's kind of like Bible verses with the letter so this is B so you start with the Berber and then this is D so you start with dezerter and then that helps them just learn some memory verses yes baby all right Lizzie show me big a and show me little a and what sound is what's the sound good job right no way what's that when you go out show me Big C and little C and tell me the sound ha I turn it around go good girl good

how we do like very basic math right sometimes uses especially I'm teaching both of them or cards so I take a few out and they get a little to count I know it you count how many blocks are here 1 2 3 4 good job and how many on this side Noah 1 all right so we're gonna do 5 plus so five plus two makes one seven and now if I add these two to these five how many do we have Noriko so five plus two equals seven good job so sometimes we use this another option is to get cut so what number sis anyone to good job what is this sign ah good one time to pick an easy one what number is that all right now count what does three plus two equals decide so three plus two equals three plus two eat cause good job good job you can count five on one hand as well okay all right moving on I sell laughter I'm going to show you real quick is how we kind of taught the twins to spell and write himself so see these big nice enough to write the afternoon you know how to trace properly so I find these tracing

at the end of August basically they're three now but basically they turned four and then the following week they start school she will see we are pretty keen on doing home school stuff and it is possible even with a very young children I think you just have to be kind of creative I guess just so you can make it fun and interactive so anytime I do find things which you kind of help us parents out to make home school and reading and helping yourself development a lot easier I definitely want to make sure I share it so I want to shout out a great company which sent me some books which is what Caleb was going through a moment ago I'll just show you them and here they are so these are from a company called pattycake and I'm sure a lot of you've heard them already and the great thing about is they launched some new books this year and they have different sections I love that they are mainly focused on younger children so the early books are 0 to 18 months which is for Kayla cuz he just turned 1 and then there's like 3 year olds or preschool and then they have 4 years plus so we've got some some core books which actually focus on the fast this one's more for babies going on about a year and a half and the notes are around the three year olds and they also have an amazing face book which means you so definitely recommending parents out there check that our new books are available on Amazon and with that said thank you to Pat a cake for sponsoring today's video yes I can see you never you're so handsome thank you gonna be a mommy's boyfriend oh yeah yep so the great thing is to celebrate their new series and it also sending us to a farm today you excited oh my we can then try to just check out the content of the book and compare it to what we see in real life

myself cuz you know I just came back from the gym and I'm not looking great there's like an intense workout and this is just by a long tall Sally because y'all know I'm a Tartar sister a 6foot sister so that's mainly a place I get most of my clothes it's really hard to do this dress when we pull a dress it's more like a jumpsuit justice but it's got these like little shorts here and it has this cute little cape which I really love it's just a really nice I guess transitional outfit as we go into fall so it's not too summery but it kind of keeps me warm with the long arms which is nice

for my makeup but I'm trying to do at the moment it's all at the party invite for the twins upcoming fourth birthday party I still can't leave my kids my babies are turning 4 but I'm so glad I do not need to add I need to my todo list because I absolutely hate ironing and this clothes does not require any of that so I'm just gonna get ready cuz some night are heading out for my friend's birthday party and my fat mummy and daddy turn up yeah always No we had a really good night and we are now ready for bed it's kind of funny there's still people there right now we left early but I think it's just you know either getting or just parent life setting up for me it's just going home and just being in my bed and some night both have work in the morning so we have to just make sure we're back early Sam is going to go and check up on Noah because we heard him on the monitor saying he need to go to the loo and I've got Caleb here this is true sleeping parent life like for real he's actually really good through the night so he's not gonna wake up he's he's good for the night now so I realized I haven't done comment of the week it's been like the longest day someone which I do that real quick right now the comment I'm sharing is from Olivia love and she says you both look like you had wonderful time but beyond did you have better luck finding shoes to fit you and if yes can you do a hole please there's actually a very good idea this was from our trip to Italy we're super excited I thought oh yes the you know fashion everything I need to find she is my size but no the shock was so real there as well what I did do with like a massive a saw shop before we went so I made I could do like an I saw store haul because I haven't done one in a while I probably will do it on my other channel because I general needs to have a bit more content on it especially you know the cherry videos the fashion and beauty kind of videos as well so I'm working on that but yeah thanks for that suggestion there right now I'm ready for bed as they say sleep while they are sleeping so I thanks again for watching and I will see you in my next video bye"	3320

post and Matt and I separated on great turns yada yada go and read that if you want to read that and but I realized I've just spent a whole day with Jack and like doing lots of homey things and I don't want you to start reading into things because for months I've been so worried that as soon as I tell you all what's been happening every guy is me spending time with you're going to think that I am like seeing or dating um and I'm not dating him just my little buddy like the same way like Zoe or Alfie and my buddy say something I just eat eclairs when I'm pouring my heart out whoaohh with the mouth level the cream dish and um so I'm not dating him at home yeah I mean like they're not dating anyone to be clear so the thing is as well we shouldn't have to can't find that out you're all no no like suspect rustles I'm kind of just pointing out for like the minority because I know that like I know that most of you are not ever going to think that and I'm gonna be like yeah we get it but I know that just I don't I think that if I watch this I politely let's spend a lot of time together but we do just spend a lot of time together about distance though there's a lot of so much space yeah I don't want you I don't want you feet touch my feet get away from me thank you it's actually what routes me I don't wanna be its friend anymore um other than just yeah I would say I came here cuz I hadn't seen you for a little while could you both been busy doing things and also in the light of all the events I was like I would get a bit stressed from them sorts depending on you having some obviously some some sort of personal problems so it's nice to spend some time with people you like it it is just you know worry I worry about things I don't mind your daughter either I think she's alright it's nice of you to solid 6:10 I'm not no I'm not glorious note Wow in my head my head it's really good hmm let's do in real life um I'm gonna go at the end of the day what a big day of work and chores wrap it up quicker when I watch Kimmy Schmidt in my vlog sorry all felicity all righty that was a really weird note that's the way to sever felt on camera truly that's the weirdest I've

Explorer so a lot of guys may know the back in 2011 I went traveling we've actually Louis and well you probably do already knows when we banging on about it back then I was a very very shy person and I feel like after I went traveling I really saw came out of my shell a bit if that makes sense I came back a different person I went away a shy little boy came back a slightly more confident little boy but I'm a big believer in the fact that going away and traveling and doing things that are out of a comfort zone and pushing yourself with you new things is very very important and that's one of the reasons I even now obviously I'm a youtuber I get to do some unbelievable crazy cool things which a lot you guys know about but one thing that I still really love doing more than anything else that I do is traveling and seeing new parts of the world I always hate these kind of things because the camera never does it justice but you need to see your own eyes if you ever get a chance glad you're in Croatia you need to come check this place out that is so blue probably Moby Dick's and now I reckon I've heard I've heard he is I reckon he's got yeah where else could he live it has to be

see I know you're thinking but Joe how can you check the weather I'm using your phones that easily once you're abroad I can actually use my phone just like I've come back in the UK it's honestly amazing so it's a game it's natural game changer I'd use my phone in this country at no extra cost but I explain more about that a bit later on the vlog so we've arrived ocean beach club before it even opens oh it's a lot bigger than I thought oh my word it's huge you're gonna love this it is I thought this until I sort of four or five tables but it's not it is huge this is what it looks like

this place it's actually unbelievable and it's actually it's actually quite nice looking at it whilst it's all still empty obviously I'm a youtuber so nice being inside a lot and being on my laptop and phone but not only do they have plugs fuckers in here they have UK plug sockets and that's a year at one they have the best of boat it's almost like they know it's almost like they get me frightened before the the party actually starts I just thought I'd take some time to actually speak to you about you know why I'm here what I'm doing here exactly three is actually my mobile network anyway and one of the reasons why this is a Fun Factory this is why this whole thing is like perfect for me one of the reasons why I'm with threes because as you know I fly to LA like quite a lot of the time and when I get to LA I can use my phone at no extra cost so basically when I land I can still send texts just like a normally word I can still send my emails I can still use whatsapp but the most important thing is I can still use my apps like snapchat I can still use Instagram he's like you burn like it's just so convenient when I land knowing that I'm not gonna get like a huge bill at the end of my and then my trip I can share shamelessly I just can't say it cher shameless I can't do it I can share shamelessly it's like she shows she shows ice cut I cut you know I mean I can share shamelessly done it about it build it without a doubt the main reason why I'm with Three's because of their feel at home package that's what I use so when I when I land in America anywhere within I think as I thought there's deer 42 countries and there's actually more has been added like Portugal Greece and Germany are going to be added very very soon and actually everyone gets Germany uh very soon all 42 countries like including Germany Portugal and Greece will be available from September so I could be coming to your country very very soon keep it out for me I'll be back we've been pouring leave must lose my suitcase because I've got a habit of um um my bags not being arriving in the airport so what are you doing what are you doing look where you are and you're under a towel ah I can't see too subtle everyone's looking at you thinking who is this guy oh I'll let you off yeah we're gonna end it here um Lucy's just extended her check out until 11:30 oh no that's for us I don't know oh you can try and do the same down now on the phone so we're not go on Joe's boy hey where's the phone man it's nothing yourself got some I check in online for my flight later on today to Barcelona go

couple items on this racks it's our first shoot that we're doing like not in a studio I'm kind of nervous and I didn't want to be too crazy so I think we have two models and then just like five outfits for each girl so those are over there we're leaving this tomorrow and then we're coming home like the next day so we're literally not I'm going to be there for 24 hours and then these over here I ordered some prints for our room and I did not get the right size they are huge yeah that's up so I do a little mini haul though the first thing I got is this jean jacket it is so so so cute I love how it's like distress I thought that was adorable so I got this little tank that I'm wearing it's really soft I love the material I always like to be super comfy so usually if I'm shopping for some type of basic it has to be like a really really really comfy material so this material is really nice this is just like super basic like red tank top and then I also have a dress that's in the same color this is our Havana nice dress and I really like it I love really really simple basic pieces so this is just like the same color has a little tie in the front it's like a mini dress and this is literally just the perfect summer dress for me because you just throw it on and you'd go out the door I have a couple other dresses that are like that so that's from our summer collection and so it's the jacket and then this dress is too so this would be perfect for like the beach or the pool or just like any time you need to just like throw something on it's just like this really simple gray may dress my favorite part is I really like the back it has like the little typing so yeah I'm obsessed with this but I think I think this is my favorite one I can't decide this one is so cute so it's another mini dress or a little bit longer on me so I'm like pretty short so they're kind of like MIDI slash maxi like a little bit on the longer side but not all the way down to your feet but I really like that link so this one is just tan and are like a cream color and I think the back of this one is also really cute though I might wear this to California tomorrow we're flying on Spirit Airlines and you can only take like a personal item with you so I'm going to try and shove all of those clothes into a personal item along with like all the stuff that I'm going to bring I guess I could just pay for a bag but we're only going for like the days I really want to just keep it simple yes I'm planning on wearing the same outfit like on the airplane to the photo shoot and then home the next takes we're literally just saying like one night we'll see how that goes then this is one of my favorite shirts and I'm so glad that I got this because when we launched our summer collection I didn't think to like go like get what I wanted before we launched it so a bunch of my favorite stuff sold out and then we like restock some stuff and I finally got to go in there and like pick out like the items that I wanted so so happy that I got this shirt I don't even know if this is from the summer collection but I think we just restocked it but it's like a really silky material and the pocket on it is so cute so it's just like a pink silky shirt and it's just so cute and so comfy so I love that then I also got this bodysuit it's just kind of like plain and simple so I thought this would be really cute with like some shorts and a bandanna or something so it's like a little ripped material kind of like a tan color I also got these white shorts I like them because they are the Shred flake on the focus and on the bottoms so those are cute we have a couple of really good basics that are like super nice quality but like really inexpensive so I got this tank top it's like my favorite color I pretty much got a lot of stuff like in this color but then these are my favorite we have like the best comfiest shorts in the store so these are just navy blue I love that they tie and just like so cute and their double layered so they're like I just love these like I'm going to put these on right now I have on sweatpants sounds cold but I'm going to put these on then I have some Free People stuff so I got this cute white top so it's like stretchy on the top it's really really really cute I love like the texture up here I always say cute so much and everyone comments on it but I don't even think about it until like later when people are commenting it but I just noticed excited said it like 10 times in a row but whatever I go to my closet and I realized they don't really have like a lot of basic like just good quality basic tees so we have these alums from Free People so I have it in gray for one material it is just really soft and really comfy so even though these are a little bit pricier I feel like it's good cuz I bought like really cheap basics before that are like a good like nice white tshirt or gray tshirt and usually they just end up with holes in them so I really wanted to get these three people ones so I have it in gray and then I thought it in white too and then we also have like a darker color like kind of a black color but these are just like closet essentials and are good quality so they last me a long time so I got those and then I got these these are like super popular a lot of you guys love these so this is a pink power top so it's just so cable obsessed and then it also comes with matching pants and I love anything that has like a matching set execuse match I had to get them so yeah it's just like a really comfy to what suit so excited that I have all this especially like I talked about it but I liked wasn't able to get it but now I have it and I'm so excited I think I have two I have three more things so this dress this is I went to a wedding the other day and the whole time so I didn't have this dress yet I was like oh my gosh I wish I was wearing this dress it would be so freaking cute I'm going to another one like next week so I'm going to wear this this is the I think it's called the retro love dress but it is so cute it is seriously just like so freaking beautiful my favorite colors like I just said then I got this do like it's obviously summer right now but I really wanted to get one of these so it's a sweater and you're kind of wearing like off the shoulder a little bit so this part is like kind of stretching like comfy I just thought this would be cute like more in the fall time with like some shorts or like pants if it's cold but yeah I really wanted to one of the so it's just like I like it's a sweater but it's still kind of like lightweight which is good so even actually this would be really cute on my trip to California with my family in like a month it's it'd be perfect for like sitting outside oh yeah I'm for sure taking that it gets kind of cold at night so then I have some jeans I really like these because I think the ankles on them are super cute they're like frayed and in the front like seasons kind of go up a little bit higher and they also have rips in the knees and I love it they're really don't look really stretchy but like they're just kind of like they're not super stretchy but that kind of stretchy they're just like a comfortable material okay oh they're not stretching that much but I've like worn them and put them on and tried them on and I like the way that they fit so that's where I got them do four super super Q and then I also have a couple pair of shoes so we've had these on for a little and I'm loving this style of shoe my feet slip on flat so I'm really excited I got a pair of these they're just like really basic you can literally wear this with anything and they're super I haven't wore mine yet but like they just look super comfy wanted to get these and two other shoes that we have in the store so I've been trying to like wear heels more usually I'm a flat person but I've been trying to wear heels and so I really like these ones because they're like basic and they go with like everything sore neutral color then I also got this little white waist choker this is like super look really cute again yeah so that's really I'm going to cute again

jewelry so this is a choker set so it comes with like this black choker so that's not really like dainty or anything but you don't have to like wear it all at the same time okay it mines kind of tangled together but basically it's just like a bunch of layered necklaces that are really cute can we get this one out well we have a couple of these ones left I presume these ones are like really inexpensive if you guys like this you should definitely go get it right now some pretty sure we're almost sold out of these but this is just a cute little like owl necklace and I just got a new jewelry organizer that I'll show you guys later shocked enough on necklaces yeah so it's just like a little cute little owls at again I'm sorry I also have one more pair of shoes but I got so I thought these booties were the cutest thing I've ever seen I really like the studs and I also like the color I don't have any booties this color even though it's summertime you can still wear these with like shorts and stuff they're really really adorable and I really like that so I'm excited about those I have like so many clothes right here but fun facts Parker actually probably has like twice

"yes_I CHEATED  THE MICHALAKS  #AD.txt"	"a few weeks ago Dorset cereals sent us an email asking if we'd like to hang out with them a festival in Oxfordshire Dorset series believed life should be about taking pleasure in the simple things in taking it slow and not just a great breakfast then while we like the sound of that the last time we actually went to a festival we left early because of when it rains let's give out 11: keepa bar but we owed it to our inner hippies to give it another shot and try to understand the appeal of standing in the field with members of the public so with open minds we all jumped in the car and went to hang out with our major dorcet cereals and we're so glad we did anyway on with the show ah this is according to the pamphlet the last Cornbury music festival the fabulous finale 2004 it was checked up by a gentleman called it looks like Hugo who signed it here and in that time he has had a wet kiss mainly Winehouse and a funny insult from Robert Plant and said your festival is very beige this is a bit of a parent festival I'll be honest you've got like bloody Bryan Adams playing tomorrow you can get more parentsí from Bryan Adams we're not festivals are full of people who are like taking their little bit too far nobody hears he shielded too far trust me maybe had one glass humor too many Pinot Grigios maybe an extra falafel is about the size they push out here I just want to have fun young foldout chairs once you're better Bryan Adams and remember what it felt like to be young and free yes we met a nice go clubbing when I was young people would think that people would like form circles around me when I was dancing and like take like video little cherub look at this line excitable he's doing they will be laughing cheering and I get free entry to clubs with people coming in to watch me play boys be honest that's a lot they stopped doing it they're kind of exploiting the other yes Thank You Mei allegedly thing for that I'm eating potatoes because potatoes are vegan now this is hard I won't like was it hard makes it very low seed first talk about why exercise doesn't illegal because I even thought about that myself a lot and I'd love to say like it's a 100% because I really care about animal welfare I'd have to say that and if I was a nicer person that would what would be the main driver but that's not the case I just come back from my little shower expedition in the woods I've got to say I don't think I ever envisaged going camping eight months presents not really something was like on my list of things to do before we have this baby but I'm so glad we're doing it because so far it's been so much fun it's a high percentage there goes into this cocktail of reasons but I think some of the reasons with that and some of the other reasons where the fact is I I'm in a period in my life now where I feel there's lots of turbulence in terms of like we're about to have a baby we've just moved from London to bar one feet about to relaunch and a little bit scared and I don't have control over a lot of stuff and I feel like this is my way of having control over something so I can't deny that being a factor you have to say to yourself no I have enough control over myself feeling and I myself don't think you walk away at the end of our thinking I do have control over like my life and what happens in my life and my decisions I better go and get the boys go and see what they're doing get Gracie is little jammies on and now I'm going to get up really ungracefully so I'm not quite sure how this is going to

"yes_I NEED TO DO THIS MORE OFTEN  Ali Gordon - Ad.txt"	"good morning has everybody been so this is the first week I've spent in UK for over a month and a half and it has been so productive I cannot tell you it's been amazing today's Friday and I decided that because I've had such a good week at work and I've got so much done I'm just gonna have a fun day it's gonna chill out enjoy some time with some friends so I've managed to organize it to go quad bike in with my best mate which we're gonna do this afternoon so I'm so excited about that because I love going out on the quads so much fun and then this evening I'm gonna be catching up with Carrie and Lydia after they finished their day's work in London and we're gonna be going to proms in the park so today it's gonna be a fun day I've also planted up in this video with weather shockwaves they have two new products that they've just launched and they are star Refresh sprays one's a revival one's a volume and I've been using them a lot recently and I'm really impressed with them some of you might have seen previously I've done a hair tutorial video using well a shock wave products so if you do want to see a hair tutorial video I will leave a link in the description box for that down below but we cannot waste any more time because the day is flying away so I'm going to grab a coffee go to my morning run and get ready to go to war bike and I'm looking forward to it let's do this so I've just finished off a morning run which was so refreshing I always say this every time I go out for a run and I come home I'm like I wish I started every single day like that I like to do it at least once or twice a week but I should really do it every single day because it just feels you have so much energy it's like the nicest feeling ever but we're showered done my hair got dressed ready to go quad bike in at experience the country in MK so it's gonna be a really really good day so the first product that I use this morning was this well a shock wave volume style and refresh spray and to be honest with you I kind of felt like that was enough I didn't really need to go over my hair again with a hair spray it did just give it a little extra hold using the hair spray but the sort of texture that this gave me almost made me feel like I didn't really need to apply so I could definitely have got away of just using that this morning the spray it contains tapioca to help cleanse the hair and it also has silica in it which is really going to volumize your hair so when you're looking for like a lift to start the day off and more volume within your hair it's a great product that I've found to use before using any other products because it really helps just lift and keep a fuller lighter look that's the hair done ready to go out really looking forward to this afternoon as always we're running late so we're going to shoot off and meet other guys our quads let's go you so we've just arrived experience the country here in MK can't see quads are over there I'm gonna be gone out a second hi yeah you're right hello Malcolm to a hankerchief run today just getting four what area is this one is that y'all I don't see me sorry yes first comes about sir blue please with Maya haha they are fire so we've just finished off my biking and as true British weather would do it decided to rain so we're completely soaked which is no fun but we had such a good time and we probably about half an hour 45 minutes behind schedule because we decide to stay on the squads for a little bit longer then we had planned of course why wouldn't you so not really got a lot of time so we're just gonna like refresh here and then we're gonna head for a late lunch before this evening activity so just gonna start being dressed and into some nice comfortable dry clothes for lunch and I'm just gonna sort out this hair so as you notice we want a helmet completely messed up it's been really sweaty and greasy so this is the perfect time to use the one a shockwave through revival products which is really great for getting rid of any residue and any excess oils that have built up during that activity so I think it's worth this now first things first I'm gonna brush out my hair and try and shape it the best I can to try and bring my hair back into its normal shape just brush it out any of the old product as well it was left it in from earlier shrunk it myself like a fresh clean based work so now finish brushing through my hair you can see I've got a little bit of shade back in it which is great but there's zero control so this is where I'm going to be using the brute local spray it's going to get really nice matte texture and it's going to get me control to my hair again it's just gonna coast me through nicely so let's give it a go I can already feel it working into my hair every sets in I start to feel the protective building I'm starting to get more control where I shape it and styling so it's as simple as that a hair from texturized that you cleanse this really is a very convenient bottle with small pocket size and take it anywhere with you and if you ever need a freshen up then this is one of those hair products it's gonna get you out of the mud so very convenient but I'm ready to go for lunch now as I said earlier run a little bit later so let's go money has arrived chicken is that next scene hurts not happiness I asked being healthy today on yeah with the backup kids it's good so we just finished off having a bite to eat with the boys and not gonna lie for like a bit of a food coma but we're gonna head back now meet the girls but a minute whoever's looking pretty good so promising apart still looking promising but it has been up and down all day so we'll see how we get on so just got back from lunch and come to meet the girls we have a very very sloppy Lydia but she's just given us some bad news she's just told us that promise in the park has been cancelled which is not what we wanted to hear because that's gonna be a nice evening do you agree yeah so we've just been having a chat and we have a couple of options we can either still go out to a local pub with the group of friends that we were gonna go to problems in the park with or we can stay at home and just enjoy a snuggly night in with some champagne or gin in Lydia's case and that's what we've got other side so we're gonna see what we want to do and make a move from there but where we are I am gutted about prawns in the park because the sun's out now and now apparently they've got water in the bandstand so yeah obviously it was gonna be like classical music yeah all of the there was like heavy rain and then like it's there's more heavy rain skips scheduled scheduled scheduled release days and so they were like it's not really gonna be very nice it's gonna get all muddy and some coriander picnic yeah like to put in your blanket down on damn floor I get it so yeah bad times day I don't know let's see we're gonna see you when we've made a decision right so we finally made a decision and the decision was to come to Stoney and me offerings here for a couple of drinks the rain has come back let's come back to stay to agree is absolutely pouring it down like a little kid you did it very small down that kind of like is gonna finish off our day sadly we didn't get to go to ponds in a part because it would have been I'm God I would ever go about it cuz I've done problems before but we're gonna come and enjoy some drinks anyway and I think this is a good time to wrap up the video so I hope you've enjoyed it and I'd say that the weather shock waves dry schampoo texturizing sprays have both done a fantastic job my hair is still in good form in my opinion I've really enjoyed using the products today and I will continue to use them if you would like to know any further information about the weather shortwaves products of course I'll be leaving them in the description box below as always so make sure you go and check those out and I hope you've enjoyed the video and we'll be seeing you next Sunday you"	1708
"yes_I'M SLEEPING WITH MY BARBER SPIDERMAN CHALLENGE  VLOG 46 #AD.txt"	"hi guys I'm almost your height while you're standing and I'm sitting soccer right oh it's romantic there's just no need for all the windows that you possess hi guys so today I'm gonna be cutting Joe's beer we've got an amazing tool that was in cutting yeah yeah we're not doing to doesn't have shaper because it's sad here it's gone wrong I am gonna be cleaning but it's not gonna put me on blast like you know it's dead boys really blunt so it's like the same color as your skin so you can't see so you caught there's no point shaping it a bit bold basically little bit I did with us two years mainly get bold because I'm nervous are you nervous because your party to 'mobile area here obviously you can see like here here so the couple is every perfect just for for obviously this bit and then underneath install alright so I got this plate that I'm gonna be using on him using this blade but that's to play a music to cut him it looks like this got it hey there we go so it looks like that and then you get a white pencil to use as a marker so anyone literally anyone can use this is white ghost and I always need to shake him up because he knows that this is a foolproof way you can put it on there and then use the pen to mark it or you can just hold it there and then you start shaving so you can leave it there and then sort of shave up to it I've got some as you can I don't know if you can see the steam coming out of this towel and I've got just put some hot water till it's damp so it's not wet colouring it out and I can hold it in my arms in my hands part of me so what I'm gonna all I'm gonna do is just take that and Joe normally you have like a barber's chair but you know we're not that advanced so I would you normally tell them to lean back and then they can enjoy and you know relax I'm just gonna put the hot towel on it and then relax them and then you can kiss your client like this the eyes are covered they won't see you come in so you'll get away with it and if they ask you can always say was abused okay so now what I've got what I'm gonna pull use as shaving cream is some aloe vera juice so I have a better plant at home yeah you know to see that stringy shape I take some so I'm just mix some organic coconut oil with just a couple of drops of tea tree and tea tree with antiseptic because whatever you're shaving you do need antiseptic normally the stuff you buy I already have some of that in it but they don't is alcohol to be fair the tea tree is naturally on successive I'm just doing the other side man once I'm done clearing that I just go back with my cut buddy and I just check that everything is in order and then just fix anything that I may have mix say Joanie is a shape up on his head as well so all I would do is just follow the line and it makes it really easy because you've got the midline now that are created from earlier and you just follow that up so I just put that there and then draw the line and then draw this line so right away that one ends there's a tough line there that you just draw upwards and then there you go you see there yeah let's just pretend that this was like way Jose Harry so I just followed he's here when he's here is really fine and he's really plumb there so you can't see at all but that that's basically so I'm used to comforting and it's given me that perfect line well the reason why I like it is obviously because it's very useful when you're cutting for the first time but also I like to support black businesses because it is not that many of them out there and now businesses like Forbes GQ is only forty nine to five so it's not that expensive it comes with a bonus and then I've showed you so you get this and you get the pen and then this is how the web websites are the cop buddy's calm as you can see lime juice here perfectly so if you want to try this at home and or you just a what's the word or your barroom that I'm going to practice on your friends or wherever this is a great way for you to get that perfect shape up every time cuz I know guys take that is my little cousin from a male's perspective yeah my two cents would be there I love it obviously like I said II I was quite nervous for her to do it obviously she's she's been an amazing job yeah the lines perfectly smooth and here like I said if you all if you do your your mighty yeah the lines will be crisp even perfect so and you would look it would look like a professionally done even though you're not professional in the yet because you could be with this in your house I just wanted to add also them you can use this to shape up like the back of the beer so if you just turn from you my love so just to shape up that side you can you can use the cup on it to shape that side as well so any race obviously can use this which is why we love it because you know we're all about inclusive of all races let me trim the length a little bit but it doesn't really let me shake so I'm very glad that in finally turn it and obviously because of Josie but we see on Instagram and then it was just the contact tracing and yeah yeah oh yeah kids coming down by buying you see them and it just says I really want to thank you to call out what is that they're picking on me under the little driving thing that you stand on you seen my thing you highlight today well why is it so extra sneaky its popping them when you're gonna start doing your eyebrows oh I know that is they're the kind of look you ain't about look you see is that what gets you going I don't even I might try it definitely put too much I'll act on today we're just going to my auntie's house to basically eat and then go home it's pretty simple I mean you start cooking we think is right we didn't get back in like two seconds I got a seat I got a snow I didn't why do you know you see the picture so me and Joe have been like vegan for a few days today so yeah we're trying hi hi YouTube come on Feb everyone starts right don't hang out with me not to say hi YouTube I'm gonna say hi hmm hmm I come in all right Mike of use are you looking at my you're fragra yes how she's like to plan to to her head as soon as I be excited it's beautiful we were just saying she was just saying that she loves what are you tired of like the reason why I said it was very nice doesn't smell like just just in case you're wondering so Joe Pesci between the white person as is he has them cleaned up being a child come here it's not recording how unfortunate what so just it's open on Instagram nothing would be actually quite fun let's try stereo virus in the surah ahzab anima Travis divider and obviously when you know some form of entertaining sugar is gonna go down I believe the camera with me anyway so I've got what the Cody basically the partner has to travel around the partner's body without fit in the floor god knows what they call it this is a little cook was challenged however I'm

"yes_IM NOT ALLOWED TO SHOW YOU THIS YET"	"Oh morning guys hello today has been a productive morning I got a crazy joy tell you do I show I can't show you I'm not allowed to show you but i can tell you i got what shouldn't probably hit it i got this this morning which is like in the kind of shower is I'm squeezed you can't tell it is one of those changeup to feel it is all of my third book finished like completely finish so as you know I've been writing this third book for blooming ages now and I don't even know if I've told you much about it I should probably do that sometime soon because it's coming out in like march I think it's coming out the end like the 24th of March that's what I think it is so I've written all of this book and right let me put you down let me be honest with you let me tell you some stuff right here we go right the way in which my third book has happened we're going straight into it in today's vlog but a minute I've need to show you my breakfast to my lunch yet so the title of my third book is called the scrapbook of my life I came up with this because I basically wanted to do I don't want to do like a biography because obviously I'm only 22 so I've still got a lot of my life to live yet hopefully and but I wanted to give people more of an insight because you guys love these daily vlogs I wanted to almost create like a daily blogs from my whole life going back well then going forward so I came up the idea to do a scrapbook of my life and it literally looks like a journal like a scrapbook it's not like the pointless book it's not like that kind of thing it's like a scrapbook of my life so I literally started I got where is it I don't know where it is I got a notepad and I asked my publishers how many pages the book needed to be and I just wrote on all of the pages pretending it was going to be like the finished book the daily vlog suffered a little bit I didn't get to do as much in my day for you guys in these videos because I was just at home writing all day or in the office writing day but the book is done I finished writing the last page last week the same day as my driving test I finish living and now it's all just been printed what I wrote on two pages like like a book and I've got to go through and check that I'm happy with everything that I've read them because I haven't read one page back yet I've wrote the entire book and I haven't even read a page back should probably do that so that's today's task is to go through this the book so far I've got like five days to go through it make any changes that i want to make and stuff so I've seen I've seen like most of it already that as we're going along we've been going through it back on it and stuff and I'm so so happy with it but I miss arrived this morning eight o'clock and i haven't yet open air and this is like well just open it sugar I don't nothing allowed to do this if my book publishers are watching it this is already online there's nothing we can do I'm not going to ask them allowed to do this or not No so it's like this do you see it's printed like this okay you can't see the pages but that's the that's one liked the scrapbook of my life happy days and then obviously all of these is just the pages that I've written if you're excited but very let me know in the comments guys I cannot wait to go through this later on and check it out and then let you guys oh my gosh my lab strip I've got like a mock front cover in there of the book I don't if I'm allowed to show you I don't know if I'm allowed I'm not going to show you today but it is blooming should I just do it anyway I feel like I'm going to get in so much trouble okay wait that I'm going to get in so much trouble for doing this guy's why are you encouraging me not meant to be doing this movement we shown you this stuff are you ready to see the front cover of book number three the guy that doesn't my merchandise designs I worked with him on the design for this often when you're doing a book the publishers do the book we like their design in the front cover in that for you I did this with my own designer because this book I just want it to be like completely from me like I've written all the pages of helped design the front cover I've done yeah this book this book is basically my life that's what it is so I wanted it to really really come from me and I'm nervous to show you this guy's I'm so happy with it though you ready this is it so it says the scrapbook of my life alfie deyes and then at the bottom there stopped Jen it says from the number one bestselling author how mad is that look at this it's all like bumped in I can't really show you British like pushed in can you see that can you see that imagine that imagine that in a shop

this morning to pop into prayer yet some porridge normally as you know when I go to prayer I've yet like a sandwich or a baguette or something today I was up early enough to get a porridge so I'm

happening in the game I'm the worst with pc so Morgan's helping me out do it helping me out do it helping me do it and it's complicated I'm literally no idea what's happening with that we've download you know the games that we want to play loads of good games the games though it was soo but it generally recording the games I still haven't decided whether it is a good idea or not that I've told you about the book but I've kind of just figured out that I know I should have caught some management or I should have called the book publishers to at least ask but if I show you at first without telling them then you're going to know and there's nothing they can do about it so fingers crossed everything goes okay and you guys are allowed to know I'm now just off walking up to town because Morgan is

"yes_Impromptu Q&A + Getting the Christmas Tree"	"hey guys I've just realized I've got really weird lighting on me the war is that these lines are from outside because the shutters and hey let me close the shutters cuz the lights weird but anyway I know this is a really rounded time to start the vlog but um I thought I'd I'm just like home alone at the moment and I just got a bit of time so I thought I'd do a bit of like a random impromptu Q&A so I just asked you guys for your questions I'm just watching back to the future and like cooking dinner I'm just cooking some chicken and some butternut squash in the oven waiting for Jason to come back from his training session sometimes when he's training on stuff I've got a bit of like extra time so I thought I'd answer some of your questions because I haven't done a Q&A or anything like that on this channel for ages I could more laidback sort of one chiama be us what's your favorite memory from high school / college love you thank you I'm one of the birthing bull I don't have that many good memories from high school because I hated high school and also over here I know like a lot of people call it secondary school but my first high school that I went to was actually called high school like in the title so that's why I think that's why I just call it a high school by default anything I hated high school or secondary school whatever it was so shit but in college I just like I don't I think I quite like to my heart foundation course but I really enjoyed that just like just like trying out different art forms and always hiccup I've been here coping so much over the last few days it's something funny it must just be cuz all the way organs like squish and I keep hiccuping all the time yeah art foundation was good I did that reading reading reading TV you I think it was cool um just fun sorry Sara 99 J asks what sure what are your biggest fears when it comes to parenting I don't really how definitely have any I just don't see any point in kind of thinking about fears of the future I mean sometimes I do look like anxiety like before events and stuff like that but I mean longterm things like that I don't really worry about cuz you just can't control them I'm not really worried about anything to do with parenting I think I'm I'm ready for there to be loads of challenges and really difficult times like to do with it but I'm pretty I don't know quite confident about it really hello yeah I am a little bit worried about helping her with homework because I'm not as you know I used to be quite academic but like I hate the schooling system I just don't agree with it so having to like deal with her oh I don't believe in homework as well I think I should be banned but that's probably for like another day so I know asks what she think you and Jason when I design next for November night and we've actually got a piece that's going to be coming out before Christmas it should be coming out before Christmas so we're so excited for that bloody finally come out because it was supposed to come out at the same time as the jumper so that will be a skirt that's exciting and then we're working on the spring/summer collection so we already know what pieces we bring it out flight next year more mindful you us what do you want for Christmas this year that's a good question nothing really like obviously nothing I know everyone always says that but because she's do so close to Christmas I just have not been thinking about like I haven't been thinking about Christmas shopping or anything as wider and all I want is just give birth and to just enjoy her I don't I don't think I do not and I know at the same time I don't care that's all about any like presence at all from for me this year I mean serenity candle maybe Nora Oh God make the names are so hard at all the time Nora and Nina Ferris asks are you doing vlogmas this year I think we're going to but obviously obviously I haven't been great this year at like day logging and sometimes I get a lot of stick for it and but I just shot I tried to do it I just tried my hardest and obviously we don't know when she's gonna arrive I feel like she's coming tonight so funny if she did so I think we might well I think I'm gonna try and do it or some sort of version of it yeah I think it'll be really nice to look back on because it's such an exciting time like the end of the pregnancy and the birth and everything so we're just gonna play it by ear and maybe we'll like vlog as much as we can I'm not sure I can't wait to get the Christmas tree I'm so excited so I asked on snapchat as well any questions Daisy Jane hey asks are you planning on doing a fitness such postmoney workout plan for after the baby if so will you publish it a fitness doing post pregnancy workout plan yeah I definitely want to get fit again oh oh my god like like being able to run again will be amazing I don't I don't even love running but just cuz I haven't been able to do it for so long I think I love running even for like 510 minutes and then yeah just doing cardio again and yoga like I could do yoga now but I don't really enjoy it with a big bump so um I don't know if L and publish it we'll talk about that much because I'm not an expert like eat a tummy hem broth yeah funny actually I asked lighting I asked Jason the other day if he'd get a tattoo to do with her cuz cuz he's got the dogs know that she's like the dogs but you know I mean and he said he would yeah I probably would I don't know what exactly I don't want to just get the name I want to get like something better but yeah of course we'd let her get can see he's got weird tattooed up so that would be hypocritical if we didn't I think at 18 definitely hi what is your tip for studying because my exams are soon and I need help oh I wish I could help but honestly it's been so long since I studied I hated the whole bloody school system I hated studying I'm really the worst person to ask like I rebelled against everything to do it school like I I did my best but I didn't do anything like extra but I didn't have to do so I don't really have any studying tips so hard takes me ages to come up with names for things so I really couldn't give you like a name straightaway but it would dare I think it would definitely be like a muskie sort of tobacco e but also sexy sort of scent like Tom Ford's my favorite scents and they're quite like musky and strong so yeah I think it would be a strong one not like a sweet girly one I don't know what the bottle would be like probably black some sort of let me go and check on the food isn't it it's burning and I'll answer the question and my favourite Christmas film is probably the Grinch I don't know it's really hard I love elf let me just set you down I know the kitchen looks really messy just how it is right now yeah I love elf I could I always watch elf and I always watch The Grinch it's not burning which is good okay I think I'll just answer a few more questions I might stay here look at my skin or my foundations where I can't think I can't think of anything specific I just love London at Christmas like there's so many areas of London is so nice I don't know I guess like South Bank winter wonderland anywhere where there's like you know little market stalls and stuff and also like the Natural History Museum because that ice casing there so pretty okay that's an interesting question sex before marriage well I think just like just do it like I'm I don't know I've never been like really strict and I wasn't that sounds bad but like I wasn't brought up with I was brought up really strictly about like sex before marriage and stuff I was just brought up to like be safe use protection and you know just be smart I don't know for me it's just always about making sure you're comfortable with that person I'm that kind of on that wavelength I think it's quite oldfashioned to wait until marriage but if that's what you believe that's cool but just different I believe that's a good question so when I was at uni I think my main it kind of changed to be honest like god she's moving around she's moving and at first I wanted to everything wants me a makeup artist then I wanted to just be a stylist then I was more interested in like finishing my degree and then going in and working in a magazine somewhere but then I like started up YouTube and blogging and everything and I just enjoyed it so much so I just obviously stuck at it I just loved doing exactly what I wanted to do not being told anything should we go in the living room moving Q&A yeah I just loved that I could talk about what I wanted to talk about I think that's such an amazing thing about YouTube and what do I miss about it at the beginning when it wasn't this business II just the just how relaxed it was and you know like it's small things like setting setting up now can take me so long whereas before they even like in the early days I just used to sit down literally didn't really care about what was behind me it was so easy like I all the focus wasn't on at like the look of everything it was really just about whatever you felt like chatting about like didn't overthink the content too much and these days I feel like I like overthink my content too much sometimes and like comparing yourself with other people as such you know it happens so much more now compared to back in the day so but I think it's really natural for like everything to progress and evolve and you've just evolved so thank you guys for your questions it's so nice like having a little chat with you guys I should do this so much more I'm going to sign off because I'm getting quite tired my back hurt so I'm going to go and like sit with my hot water bottle but this look is a little bit jumbly because we got a new mattress the other day and it is bloody amazing so I wanted to put that footage in because I filmed us taking our books everything and and I thought if I put that at the beginning it might not make sense just because that would be around a bit of footage so anyway I'm gonna put that in now so you guys can see I oh my god it's made my sleeping so much better already like I don't want to get out of bed in the morning but anyway I'll see you guys in a bit so we've had a delivery today that we're really excited about and it's a Casper mattress and we've both heard of them before birth yeah so we put it in a super king size that wasn't me yeah we're gonna unbox it and change up my mattress I'm really excited too because yeah if any of you know I haven't sold me I'm hoping help yeah and yeah it just helps everything because Jason's got a bad spine and with the pregnancy and everything it can be tricky to sleep so hopefully this can help if you wondering why were in the bathroom it's just because there's a bit of space in here I'm happier in the room okay let's move into the bedroom okay let's hold him there your password sorry I'm just gonna pull that trigger yeah just puffs up it's really so how's it feel I'm just gonna put the sheets back on and then I want to read I really want to try it out with all of our with the duvet on and everything it's a bit later um I've just had a bath and everything then mattresses properly like sprung up now it's like fully fully sized that didn't actually take long either so I just changed oh do you guys like my dressinggown you guys are just seamless if you watched my loungewear haul I think it was in that video but yeah I love it I've already like prissy when I wear it I'm so excited to sleep on this mattress tonight like I know that's such a nerdy thing but honestly it's oh I can't wait I wanted to let you guys know that I'm gonna put a special link down below for this mattress and also I'm gonna have a promo code so if you guys use it you can get $50 off and then it's gonna be Casper com4 Sammy just eating some chocolate but yeah I was looking at everything to do with the mattress and it says it's made with springy latex and also supportive memory foam so it's good combination also they do free shipping so yeah but you guys might like to know hey guys it's Sunday we're just about to take the dogs on our Sunday dog walk yeah so we just get ready to go and then we're gonna go for a lunch as well I feel like we always block the same thing on Sunday but if they've got a turkey neck or part of a tender and stuffing lunch was so good we tried a new thing Hey we pulled a machi we tried anything and it went down well we're just about to go and get our Christmas tree which is so exciting and because it's a 27th of November so we thought it might be a bit too early because usually wait till December but it is December coming up this week so we thought me here they are oh yeah so when I go with the Nordmann fur which of these babies I really like this one I know it looks a bit odd on camera but we'll put that edge at the back yeah let's go home I don't see much they'll think of going into filming the film but once I forgot like kamerad cinammon it was really embarrassing thank you watching Tess what are you watching me watching brilliant for keeping skin hydrated hey guys it's the morning after we oh I really liked arrival but I'm just doing my makeup sorry I've really liked hey Frank really really enjoyed it we went to see nocturnal animals the other week but I really liked that because it's my kind of like dark dark kind of film that this was read like it was a better film I don't know I don't know like the story was really good so I highly recommend going to see it really like Amy I don't think that's her name she's so good it's just uh just really interesting film was my favorite but I just thought I'd end this vlog because I was gonna end it obviously last night and I never end up ending vlogs in the nighttime we just came back home and we got gourmet burger kitchen takeaway and sorry I'm pissed if he fall asleep he's sleepy my boobs have like puffed up even more over the last few days it's ridiculous just thought I'd own this book because I didn't do a proper ending last night I'm trying to like do emails and stuff and Frank's like jumps up on the chair next to me in here just you keep running my attention but yes thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next

"yes_IS THIS WHAT LIVING IN LA IS LIKE A NEW 2 MILLION DOLLAR CAR - VLOG AD.txt"	"hello programmed hello today we are going to LA so I'm gonna call this like an LA blog because we are lost we haven't been in like three years and we are going back part work part fun I'm very very excited you can see I've got a bit of a a broadly Brown highlight thingamabob going on right now and I kind of like it it's kind of different behavior okay he's try okay I'm not stressed about nothing right about this so I was not doing everything out why while I hold the camera okay guys so we've arrived to our hotel we're staying at the Waldorf Astoria Anthony Harold's fancy ha it's amazing the service and I too know what it is about a good hotel it's the way that people make you feel when you walk in veteran make you feel very welcomed and it's so important I think my number one thing when it comes to staying anywhere I'm going to show you around my skin after that flight is so so dry and I'm going to don't even kill myself a little bit of a treatment facility totally need that right now to embrace the one the balcony but what do you think darlin water she's pointing here's the front of the hotel this is like right by Rodeo Drive once it means Southie look at these views great what do you think like it let's have a look here here's the room lovely it's elegant it's gorgeous look at this but for me the thing that is giving you guys I love a bathroom I love a good bathroom and this is a great bathroom got lots of space for like oh yeah look look at this you don't even have those involved you open breathing oh so just step into my office this is where you write mmm well I love their bins in my RV thank you I can close the door in your face Josey done is unpacked I'm just feeling a bit just drying a bit tight so if I need to do everything right now but whenever I go to a hotel and I do like unpack almost art and just sort everything out and then I can relax I'm going to use my clean e this is my take the day off cleansing van this is the mini one this is one I travel with all the time I'm just going to use my exfoliating cleanser after flying your skin can felt very very dry because it really does take up the moisture out of your skin something like those planes right I'm going to use this you guys might have seen is from IPR unboxing this is a hydrating supercharged concentrate do it is really really good hydration and for me after a flight is absolutely perfect because listen the ash unit is trying to come through and it's an ultra lightweight formulation which is great if your solid days only but is dry and if that makes sense but for me definitely it makes sense and the good thing is I'm a relatively oily person so this is in a gel formula and for me I prefer gel it that's got lots of oil in it but even if you have oily skin your skin still needs really good moisture and I find that if I don't give my skin the moisture it means it will go crazy oh and it only costs $34.99 it is much beautiful naturally I know I know I know a lot about yeah it's nicer just give yourself a little bit of a treatment and get off of a plane if you are traveling even if your oily even if you're dry it's very important so yeah going to add a little bit of my brown this is one deal and it's like a colorless bomb and whenever I use it for like my lips are really nourish what's crazy already for just a little bit more settled in okay I am miss orange shades of orange today I feel like when in castle you need to kind of wear some color yeah it fell but you have to wear color here so no maybe that's in my head and I bought my cabinet one sensual enhancer concealer on and I'm reliving this was an old favorite walk it back out and it just it just bang it just bangs like wow love it look who has awoken from that match is a bit grumpy so she's having her milk right now but after milk she's all good she's at me when I'm hungry she definitely gets hungry I wanted to put my hair up but it's down now and I ended up putting on these littles sandals they're so so nice they are they are designer but basically I bought a bunch of stuff on farfetched because they have a sale on and these are Alexander McQueen sandals and they're so amazing and I got them for 130 pounds down from like three hundred and something pounds and for me you can I spend on shoes and I spend on bags and that's really it but the rest of my outfit is misguided okay so Michael's wearing the top shot tshirt that I bought him guns out sun's out he's gonna keep playing well or you bought me but I still not buy it for it's just that I'm more like official stylist yeah yes great you ready to go lovely she's like what's going on over here so we've come up use our amazing but this

"yes_LEARNING TO ROCK CLIMB"	"morning everyone so I felt over to film a weekly vlog I've done a couple already and I absolutely loved them means I get to film a little bit throughout my whole week which i think is actually better than filming like a whole day if nothing that exciting happening so hopefully this will be fun it's currently 10:00 to 7:00 in the morning on Monday and I'm about to go to Barry's boot camp class I haven't been to one for a while and they are so intense so I need to like hype myself up this get myself Abed and though it should be good and there we go eyeball topped with Lizzie's high protein granola okay you guys are going to think I'm so totally mad I am about to go rock climbing I don't even know how I'm about to do this why should I begin for the most intense class ever this morning before going rock climbing I don't know Danica I was really expecting the class this morning to be that hard even though I've been before but the reason I'm going rock climbing is because I am setting myself a challenge this week I have never been rock climbing in my life ever and by the end of this week I want to be able to climb the toughest rule that is possible within this rock climbing Center I don't even know so specifically impossible like I don't know how hard this is going to be because I've obviously never done it before so I have nothing to compare it to you so the reason I'm setting myself this challenge is all to do with sleep so Temper mattresses have sent me this challenge to see if sleep can help me achieve something that I've never done before really really just push my boundaries and see if a good night's sleep is going to help with this so Kendra man chooses have these incredible foam mattresses and pillows so I've got them I've had them for a couple of weeks my absolutely love them I'm going to show you actually let's see here we go this is the mattress and I don't know if you guys are familiar with memory foam mattresses but they are so comfortable it's like you just mold into them and it's just so cozy I love them this is what I want to do I just like like putting my hand in and then seeing it is so good and there's also got the pillows as well I'll show you them at first from I am first got them and I pulled them out of the cover I was like wow these feel really different and then selected them and they just so amazing it's like your head just moves into them again here we go so this is what it looks like as you can see like it's not as firm almost as the mattresses and that's what I thought memory foam pillows were like okay they're going to be exactly like the mattress rest for your pet basically like smaller versions of mattresses like a little mini mattress but they're not they're like designed in a different way they're softer and like more more squishy and just so cozy see I've got those got my two pillows got my mattress and I'm going to go rock climbing for the first time in a minute and we'll see how I get on I think I'll probably just start on the beginner wall obviously hope so anyway and then I'm going to go middle of the week as well see if I can progress they go a little bit further or higher I don't know how it works like what were you doing and then hopefully by the end of the week I'll be able to climb yet but like the biggest wall and of course I'm really excited to see if a good night's sleep is going to help with all of this you know how much I love my sleep and I am such a firm believer that a good night's sleep can help you so much next day like I know it's obvious but I need eight hours sleep and if I don't I'm just like a zombie the next day so I'm hoping this is going to help okay so I'm in here all these walls and then I've spoken to the guy out like what's an achievable goal and basically you have different colored and like point to like grab onto I don't know what I feel like keeping was that cool heck hello and so gray is the easiest color and then it goes to like a few different ones and I asked him like what would I be able to do by the end of the week and he but if you can do orange that's really good too if you can finish your green that sounds really good so I'm going to aim for orange by the end of the week but I'll be super happy if I can complete agreeing to do this explains it so much faster so intro home and we put the yellow one green and orange I'm not even going to bother with this one when you're out there is actually so much that you can see the different colors like I'm pretty sure I just have masala green one I thought it was great we are keeping vegan brownie okay I'm going to save myself there and not have one but next from a period during the week I might have cover though I actually absolutely loved it over so much fun so I'm doing the gray ones which is like the beginner and then I included be like orange almost leaves the next apart and it was just so fun and for like exhibition with ourselves but I don't want to like kill myself on the first day so we'll see how we get on on Wednesday when I come back so back home now and I've just got emails catch up on I've got to edit a couple of videos and just general like works up so I'll probably be around here for a while got some lunch prodigy this is character fennel and ginger so good and yeah I guess just hanging out here might go to a cafe later because I like switching it up a little bit I get a bit cabin to free fun just at home all the time and and yes then cranks tonight so I last spoke to you I've said that I was going to do a little bit of work right here and then I was going to go to a cafe I never even made it to a cafe I had so much work to do I hadn't even realized that I the time has just disappeared felt like minute to go but nice now half past eight and my shopping has just arrived there we go all my food can't even remember what I've ordered now so I'm just going to put that away make some dinner and that's it

we've got these amazing heritage Tomatoes I just love all the different shades of tomatoes we've got some steamed carrots and some steamed white collar and what these are called sugar snap peas that sit on some spinach hiding at the bottom ER and these are some amazing vegan sausages they're by brand called DS and I just absolutely love them and I've also got a dressing here this is tahini and mustard and some lemon juice so just drizzle that all over and it is so so good time to get some sleep I am so so excited to get all tucked up and cozy I must say I've been sleeping so so well this foam oh my god it's honestly a life changer it's really helping as well it's obviously like quite intense workouts did spend this morning and then of this goal that I've set myself for climbing this wall by the end of the week I genuinely think this sleep is going to really help and I'm so excited about going back to the climbing wall tomorrow I'm going to try and push myself a little bit harder if I can remember it's going to be the green wall that's going to be the next thing not the green you know wall but green peg thingy so I've done grey and orange is going to be green and then by Thursday night because that's the only time I'm going to be able to go climbing again it's going to be at the time I'm going to really push myself to do a green or the next one up I can't remember I'm so bad at remembering but oh my goodness I think it's going to be really tough I found even the gray ones quite tough but it was really really fun and hopefully I can get a really good night's sleep thanks to temper of course and my pillows loving my temper pillows oh my goodness and yeah oh my god I've actually never been so excited to get some sleep back again at the climbing center going to

for anyway now I'm probably going to get on an edit this video that I have just filmed and I'm really looking forward to tonight Joe and I are going to go for a couple of drinks and some dinner I think just up a par on the corner that'd be really lovely and yes that is my day okay I need to get a boomerang of me throwing some sponges up in the air so this could be interesting if we get this

"yes_Life Admin & LA with MIKE"	"good morning guys and welcome to my second weekly vlog of the past few months thank you so much for all of your comments on the last one I'm really glad you liked it this week is going to be a bit different because I think I want to try and do like a few vlogs basically it's Monday today on Wednesday Mike and I are flying out to VidCon so I'm going to do like the first half of the week in this vlog and then there's going to be some la vlogs with me and Mike as well it is all just coming out to see you sorry Elsa someone was sit back down sit back down so it's basically been like the hottest actually yesterday was the hottest day of the year absolute hottest Oviatt today so even hotter this one's been having his breakfast outside which is why I was coming outside to see you Polly check out his new shoes as well guys this is quite embarrassing Mike rolling well I think now a bit embarrassing these are golf shoes the coolest shoes ever and if you guys missed on my Instagram I dyed my hair pink and purple yesterday and I love it the only problem is is wash out it last like I think like two or three washers so I'm trying not to wash my hair basically you're gonna smell em the next few weeks I am gonna be stinky no it's going to be good it's good to know I'm doing today waiting today there's a reason why we called the time oh you're getting your I'm going off no catch Shari chance I'm going for a fitting with pxg woo I don't know what that means if any of you guys know what that means I think it means buying things buying new golf clubs um little pig little pig what are you crunching on piggy back inside now it's too hot outside yesterday I'm basically just sourcing everything out for the trip and I've also videos I'm going to go out with my mom and trying out my eyebrows done because I have not had my eyebrows threaded I realized they look fine it doesn't have makeup in right now but they are like fluffy you know like the floss that you get like around that is back in action and doing loads of washing as well and this video is sponsored by the nor UNSTOPABLES now some of you might remember a little while ago when I went to Japan I actually did a video with nor or just after I got back from Japan last time I went to America I did a video with Lenore for their fabric conditioner and since then I'm like I've become slightly obsessed with it the point where like I'm telling all my friends about how good to smell pretty bad like pretty embarrassing that's kind of massive geek and anyway so when I was telling my personal trainer Ali who might well be watching this if you are hi Ali and Jemima then I was telling her about this fabric conditioner and she was like oh my god have you tried the unstoppable stuff for your gym gear and I was like no what is it and then the nor contacted me and asked me if I wanted to do a video with them about the unstoppable range and I was like hell yeah because we already use it so basically what it is find mine sees that all my body can actually smell and everything already good these are the lavish and basically they are in wash scent boosters so if you're washing anything really sinky like gym gear hence my personal trainer recommended them to me she was like if you're washing your trainers or gym gear it just gets rid of any smells and just makes us all really nice I've since been using it mainly for like gym get dog towels towels in general things that kind of tend to get a little bit stinky like if they get wet whatever and that was kind of just become addicted to it and I'm using it on everything and what's really good about using it for traveling is that the scent actually lasts a really long time so you know when you're packing your suitcase and you want to like open it up when you get there after a really long flight and have your clothes smelling like really fresh and nice and like home and yeah so the scent just last very long time so you can kind of like I know that if I pack everything in my suitcase is still going to smell good like at the end of the week when I'm like unpacking and repacking so changing hotels three times in five days this is our utility room there's a lot of washing going on right now oh the other thing that it's really good for is like you're smuggling stuff makes it more really good so yeah that's what this morning I actually we've actually got to washing machines this is really cool because when we moved we inherited one as well so we have two washing machines on the go and the dryer this is my favorite scent anyway the lavish one I've smelt them all in the shop and I tend to go for like those warm kind of I don't know like more like perfumey home kind of homely smelling like you would have a scented candle like a warming scented candles they're really weird as well like they're little to show you guys Mike what the last wash on and I think you may have put the cap in the wash which you're not going to do so how do we find basically you pour a few of these in with your washing and you can put like just a few in if you're doing a little wash and you don't want like a super sense boost or you can put loads in if you've got something really stinky like dog towels or smelly trainers yes and it makes them smell nice I also wanted to show you a little bit of an update on a spare room because it's being decorated so you guys will have seen this last week when the wallpaper was still on the walls when I was showing the new carpets this is all the decorators stuff he was here last week and he's going to be here this week decorating this room as well the wallpaper is off and we've been doing well we he has been doing a lot of work on the windows because these are super super old so he's been stripping off a lot of their kind of slates paint and filling them in a lot of the window frames are rotten and we're also changing the color of the woodwork from Queen to white so it's like a whole repent I can't wait till it's finished if you guys can't tell as well I'm still recovering from this down cold it's been over a week since I got back from Italy and I'm still like really really bummed up so the worst cold ever I'm so glad Mike didn't catch it but yeah I can't wait to see this when it's finished it's going to be so different when we get back because we're going away right at the time when he'll start decorating everything so we'll basically come back and it will be pretty much done I don't really excited guys can you see this it's like 10 not even 10 o'clock me and it is 28 degrees this is amazing also today guys I don't show my car very often but I've had the same car for like a very long time if you haven't seen it before this is what it looks like it matches my hair today so amazing early very very over excited about that I finished filming for the day guys I just dropped Polly who helps me with my phone rings back off at the station and I am now heading to meet my mum for lunch it is so freaking hot right now it's 30 degrees I am sweating just a little bit I think we're heading to Nando's I'm actually excited because I'm meeting my mum and my sisterinlaw Becky and my brand new niece willow and we nephew Arthur for lunch and we're going to have a little mo Zhi ramen shop and I'm hopefully gonna get the brows I just had a really nice like mom and Becky and I'm now in HomeSense I just found me which is supposed to be for the kitchen but I'm actually going to use them to organize my makeup remember when I did that like organize my makeup video while ago and so many of you were freaking out well if I though putting it all into one draw so now I found these see what we can do with them I just got back from town and this one look see look Mike what are you doing with that that doesn't stay in there you left it in last time Jenny Han oh my gosh she doesn't know Mike doesn't know you know this vlog is sponsored by them this very blog that wasn't yup guys I promise it's gonna be really good do you like them then I'm the one who does a lot around here well I do some why are you washing the thinking stuff myself this just got washed he's hanging outside 33 degrees 30 degrees if you had the best day ever you're a bit backlit glorious day I mean so much look at the blisters on my hand oh no G proud owner of new expensive golf club no virtually expenses all costs but amazing I've got a new driver which goes 50 yards of my low driver really looks really not you just hitting harder no club I've got that's new 3wood it goes 10 yards under my offering wood got a new RESCUE wood new ions really internal chocolate or version of torchon tall shaft yeah I've got a million where I'm so weary milled wedges funny what I think I'm so sweaty I'm not overly happy with my brows because they couldn't tint them oh so I bought one of those at home brows I kiss and I'm going to do that and I look so horrendous because they did my upper lip as well so have my upper lip done and my brows and so that basically that half my makeup has come off dyeing my own eyebrows casual I have actually used this for and it was really good last time this eyelid eyebrow kit so if you haven't got a patch test and you need to dye brows ASAP this is like the do at home version it's actually pretty good because they give you enough to do it like I don't know maybe eight times ten times amazing I'm pretty happy with that I was worried when the dye was on it was quite warm on you reckon this brow in on camera looks warmer in the mirror it doesn't anyway I'm actually not too happy with the way she did this one either because she's taken too much off this bottom lip and it's already faster than this one just kind of annoyed me but yeah they look good I'm happy with my at home dye job so whilst this one is still talking about golf clubs I am going to show you guys what I got from HomeSense this vars which i think is so amazing so beautiful it's like enormous that's going to go in the hallway I was twenty five pounds and then I got this cushion which I love which is for one of the spare rooms I actually put I'm going to put it on the bed and show you it's like the tiny little single fourposter bed so I got that and then I also got this throw for the end because at the moment it's all white but the room is kind of like grey and silvery and then I got these square quilted pillows I only needed one but they came in a set of two I don't have the stuff to go in the middle yet but that's also for that bed and then I got two new pillowcases for the other spare room which might told me we need to spy new pillowcases for yeah I got them found I got two because we know two of them were fine and then these we needed two anyway thousand thread count I was pretty impressed with that I got three of these like deep storage containers and then this one which is supposed to be for cutlery but I'm going to put like mascara eyeliner eyebrows stuff I'm going to show you guys what I've organized it I'm kind of excited to do that so to give you an idea this is what the bed kind of looks like but there's no cushion in this here so it's going to be like that and it's like quite grey in this room and then the carpet used to be dark green so it's now kind of gray so everything goes and yeah I love this cushion so much think it's so cute and this little bed if you guys haven't seen this before with my bed when I was a kid her mom found it an antique auction and I think it's Indian it's like a tiny little miniature full post a single reticle in love it mike is cheffing up his speciality spagbol tonight and he was going to serve it with rice which would make it a rice bowl yeah just whenever but no no no we need pasta with it yes we do this dog is one very very very hot dog it's actually really cool in here in a cinema room at moment it's probably the coolest room in the house squidgy has just gone through like 10 minutes of going absolutely bananas and now she is like passed out panting because she's a hot dog I've got piglet here looking cute and treacle bum there and then Mike is just going to find his phone because he's lost it and I'm also currently in the process of trying to convince him to watch 50 shades darker do you think we can do it guys do you think we can do it I am NOT optimistic so as I suspected I did not manage to get him to watch Fifty Shades but um we have decided together actually I'm real excited about this to watch the very last Resident Evil well resume it very well it's called the final chapter so that was actually really good I really enjoyed that however slightly misleading in fact I don't think it's actually the end what told you that smell even the other thing is the never never rent a story see you guys tomorrow morning guys look a little bit crazy today today is the day of all of that admin and the packing and all of that jazz trying to finish everything off before I leave it's very hot still piglet is a hot dog all you need is a bun now hey Pig the packing situation is happening however it's a bit of a mess I've just managed to you like pack all of my toiletries and stuff I actually really really love this case which I got from Sephora Mara Hoffman one but when I'm traveling I find it really hard to find wash bags that have like multiple compartments and this one is really good because it was this hot fire for like any medicine and stuff you've got a brush container and then under here you've got like a zipped compartment where I put like cotton buds and hair ties and stuff and then you've got the main compartment which also has these like elasticated bits in it but it's really going to fit two loads in it and it's actually really squares that's quite compacting the suitcase and then I've got some SD polishes because I'm doing something we'll see in the next couple of weeks when they cut back which is looking fairly empty actually because I always end up buying stuff when I go to LA how cool is this makeup bag by the way guys it's from skinny dip I've got a scent it last week from L'Oreal it was the coolest thing ever I love it and then these are like my inflight just dropped on these are my inflight bags so this one has like my eye mask and tissues what else does it have in here like face wipes and toothbrush and like hair bands and stuff and then this one has all my in flight skincare which I have quite a lot of origin stuff going at the moment because I've got some samples from them little I tried my cram to the magnet bar best ever eyebrow star mascara to lip gloss I mask Estee Lauder and our eye mask the best ever kill spray and hyaluronic serum from the ordinary part is a little origins eye cream the clothing situation is not nearly as organized though piglet also has a new little smoothing spot do you like sniffing under the bed little pig you're so funny there's not normally anything under the bed duvets under there at the moment because it's too hot for a duvet if you decided you liked sleeping under the bed yeah yeah funny one I spy with my little eye a little monkey dogs have clocked me like straight away Mike Mike he is supposed to be printing off our boarding passes right now he's definitely asleep in the Sun so actually in the shade which is good oh my goodness guys I've had to come and steal Mike seate under the tree because it is so freakin hot everywhere in the whole house and I'm just filming a little message for a fundraising event my friend M Ford is organizing for Grandville tower and I can't be part of it it's a livestream that's going live tomorrow and I'll see I'm going to be on a plane so I'm really sad I can't be part of it actually because it's really amazing like really really amazing she's managed to pull together a load of youtubers to do a live stream and kind of raise money for gram flour so if you guys get the chance it's will be up after that but the fundraising page will still be live I'm sure so if you want to donate to it as you guys know if you're based in the UK and further afield I'm sure like the news kind of covered it everywhere such a awful awful tragedy unimaginable like absolutely unimaginable tragedy so yeah if you guys can spare anything I'll pop a link below to their fundraising Asian go into an 8

loads of different I think this is the Wardrobe yeah but then there's like a minibar all that jazz pretty intense stores to be honest and then this is the bedroom it's quite cool like openplan there's like a mirror here with the TV in it and like a little table my handbag the snacks have already been hit up Mike they're chilling and then there's a desk like behind the bed which is quite cool some funky glassware and then the bathroom is a mirror here as well which slides so you can close the bathroom if you want but it's like openplan how cool is this thing I love it and then if you go around here there's another mirror and then this is the bathroom so all super super modern love the towel rack and then there's a toilet and the shower and that is it and I think we have about two hours before dinner and we were just going to chill we're like actually we're going to fall asleep we chill and we're saying right off the Beverly Center so we might go into a little more maybe just have a gonna have a little mosey around the Beverly Center cuz otherwise I will fall asleep it will happen wah so sunny out here guys the sun's going down at the beautiful evening view this one did some

"yes_LIVE FOR THE STORY  THE MICHALAKS  AD.txt"	"this is my first camera it's an original Canon 7d that I bought about 11 years ago so the day arrived and took it everywhere I went and that hasn't changed over the years I've upgraded along the way but it's still extremely rare to see me without a Canon by my side it's become almost an extension of myself in a way over the years it's completely reshaped how I see the world it acts as a sort of prism that forces you to take notice of things like light in this composition and shape and color all the beautiful things that are around me that were just hidden there in plain sight it also lets me echo my relationship with the world right back to the world our canons are the tools that bind this whole story together which is why we feel so incredibly privileged to this week to be working with the people that created these cameras Canon they told us about their new campaign which is about living for the story in how a photograph could be so much more than just a filament they wanted us in our own way to talk about the story behind the photograph so our idea was to find a pertinent photograph for us that represented a particular story in our lives a photograph that made us feel that moment all over again that made our minds almost bloom with memories of that particular time in our lives then we go back to the place the photo was taken all these years later so that's what we're doing today we both knew the photo we wanted to use for this campaign the only problem we had was finding it in place we took the photo all those years ago was in a room in hotel called the manor on Purbeck heritage coast to Marseilles class the hotel closed down a few years ago but a new one has taken its place we strolled around the new hotel for a while before taking Grayson to see the old hairy rocks legend has it that the devil traditionally known as old hairy one slept on these very rocks by this time yeah I think we took it before you were born the photo we chose is a black and white acid focus lively composed photos but that's not what it is to us to us it's the endless Vesper eyes is that bottle of Prosecco that we always had it's the helmet hair the Lions is that hangovers it's this passion the spontaneity the dancing is there not giving a fuck it's a film night the bright lights of London cities the whims it's the main things we had after work is the colors their mind is there it's everything that we were back then captured one still you Oh I yeah and desires you've just seen our photo and heard our story now it's your turn

she loves it and also it's going to be like basically milk with a dash of tea so this is why I send it back is my travel tea for the journey yeah so some of you guys might know Holly holy shit i'm reading everyone's channel below we're ready for you this is so exciting to me some of you guys so we're on the way I shotgunned front seat because I get really travel sick if we sit in the back and some of you guys know this but i'm not sure all of you do we're actually from dropping in so in London I know the most bizarre in London so it takes us about three hours to get to the event so I've got my little office on the go on my lap here I had looked for so long for a marble laptop keys I literally wanted this for a year and i finally found more from coconut lane I saw so many Instagram pictures with these so I find him out to get one and then if you guys ever want to know what camera i use for the lighting isn't great here this is my camera be using per se it's actually a cannon it's so well loved the thing is come on it's a 600d thereby does my hair put it on my lap just like I didn't know what it was like buddhist or a caterpillar race now under your feet but what was it doing its Caroline of that only you can fucking a like that snapchat you think that you can do with butterflies yeah yeah just put my so Holly can do a snapchat with calling the customer the hotline hi welcome to the Sheridan you made it to max factor's balama the studio I want to get kale smoothie my face is very very shiny I know sorry about that Caroline Barnes is here Max Factor's makeup artist and I need to touch up with make her focus I literally like a shiny met after that journey and I'm going to show you outside as well oh I've actually come across Caroline you'll see Caroline did a little bit doing my makeup how lucky we outside the sun shining with the sickness I love how you're out here in the sun does my idea as well wlky's fucking outside look a little guys how amazing is it so beautiful I'm going to try not to fangirl Caroline too much she's literally my makeup hero so I'm going to get her to do some foundation maybe a bit of eyeliner you know I hate putting eyeliner on but it's just so nice of a real lucky to be here with my family I've had the healthy smoothie and now I've just found the naughty macarons annoyingly though I think they're part of the display will anyone notice if I take one of the tasty morons makeup goodies go yah this is the finished look guys the freckles are free I swear something it was really natural you know me I'm not really into my massive but smoke tires or colors i'm going to show you guys really quickly a kind of mini get ready with me with what we used because it's probably taking too long to show you as we were doing it i already have this on earlier it's the Max Factor smoothie that miracle primer so I didn't need to put any more of that on this feels so soft you guys know I bang on about putting primers ohms it just holds everything in place but this one feels really nice and soft on your skin and just perhaps everything and then we've used the miracle touch foundation I've already had this for a few years so I knew I was going to like this but it has a brand new swanky beautiful packaging it is actually really beautiful I like gold and that's actually very pretty I'm obsessed with compacts as well with cushions in and this is really good just to get that nice really like flawless finish and plus it's easy just to carry around and top up as you go through the day the consistency of this guy's if you have tried it before is beautiful it goes on really really soft and satiny and just turns actually quite matte on your skin because I get really greasy so it's good to get rid of any shine and then we've used this really pretty blush it by Max Factor and I'm laughing because I'm already on my third part of this this is the max back to excess shimmer you might recognize it from some of my videos and my favorite ones in copper so we put that on today yes I'm wearing a lipstick I can't believe someone has actually managed to get lipstick on me and it actually looks really nice because this is really natural it looks really pink here but I think it looks really nice when it goes on your lips and then with you some masterpiece glamour extensions mascara I love the black brown one of this but the black one today let's really nice and then we've used a lip liner and then a little bit of eyeliner you know what I'm like this is the excess intensity and actually I think that it's really pretty mainly because it's brown so if you don't like smoky eyes like me stick with a brown I need to have seen you in ages ages you look so great happy wake up look at his hair we're just say I spent my whole life when I get curls in my head it's a frizzy very busy period be cancelled are you learn me toca música TV oh these green trees do you like it home sweet home I am so close it for today it was so good there is only one thing to do it's pampa time oh they're monochrome heavy engrave the words we don't say and at any moment I know we're gonna see the rain yeah yeah and you say oh I'm so gelo why can't I be brave cuz you let go and I let go nobody take the blame the one thing keeping my whole life it's the same thing to tell me we won't survive the colors are fade as we define it now all that's left is blue blue no that's left is blue it doesn't surprise me I've been coming over board"	1466

grow how cute are they as my car pulling up outside how exciting so this is what I'm wearing I've got H&M shorts on and ASOS a linen shirt Cloe boots and a Louie bag and it is so hot oh my god I can't even tell you I'm literally oh I am literally sweating like I've got a sweat and it's not ok but yeah I'm ready to go my cars outside so I'm probably just gonna waste a little bit more time though he's no good in your blanking hi everyone so it's Friday it's Friday and I haven't actually blogged yet today because I woke up this morning and I just like I haven't done anything today I feel like sometimes that I like like I just don't stop I continue like going going going all the time and then I just kind of like crash and I had such a good time last night it wasn't even you know it didn't even feel like work it was just it was so much fun the whole team at L'Oreal professional were like incredible and all of the girls up there we just had such a good time but I just woke up this morning and I was just like I just felt that everything yeah I was just sort of like sitting here thinking about that and thinking about how much I really want a mozzarella salad as well what do we need for a salad salad salad pal look in this straw okay so we've got salad this is good this is a good start when we want to have a salad we have cucumber this is another good start but there is definitely no mozzarella in here so Oh phone keys wallet have I got everything all right that money go I'll look wonder anyway scream at this has got to be the most unflattering Joshua oh you know Ali's been in my car what is this crap that you listen to so now that I finally had some food I'm gonna sit and snuggle on the sofa and a blanket and watch some TV away Carly's get home from the gym welcome time you went this far without me yeah I did it without me good morning everyone today is body power day so Ali has left early this morning I would have a liein because lucky for me I were working it this year and he's gone up to work with him from Body Works he just did a photo shoot with them it's gotten which he was seen in his blog on his channel so if you haven't checked out his channel yet I'll pop a link to his below but what I'm going to do is I'm going to have breakfast and I'm gonna have my coffee and then I'm going to get in my car and just hit the road up to body power and she's going to min around for a little while and see what's happening I'm probably going to spend so much money on like food and somebody I do it with time but it's just going to be nice how the chills one and just relax and have a look around that's what I'm really looking forward to just sort of chilling and enjoying body how because I do actually enjoy it so yeah anyway let's make some breakfast so for breakfast I'm going to be having some glutenfree low calorie pancakes which I do have the recipe on my blog and then to top the pancakes I'm going to be popping on at some ski yogurt from ala which is just in the natural flavor and it's fatfree and it's high in protein as well I just love the big tubs that it comes in and it means I never run out of them and then on top of the yogurt I pop a teaspoon of Burt's sugar which I asked Calgary Aven see know who is the health editor at Vogue and she said that this is perfectly good to have as a substitute for sugar so I don't really like the process one so this is just a natural sugar and then I'm going to work a load of berries on top as well so there you have it that is my lovely little pancake recipe this is on my blog but I will also pop this in the description box so if you want to recreate it you can I thought it might also be quite fun to mention that you can also enter a competition with Allah and scared yogurt you can win return flights for to to Reykjavik in Iceland where you'll have private transfers for nights accommodation in a fourstar hotel and breakfast for two adults with blue lagoons trips for two and a Reykjavik food walking tour for two adults and travel insurance as well all you have to do is upload your own little recipe to Instagram and use the hashtag to share my skin so yeah I just thought that was a nice little competition to mention that I've never been to Iceland so I'm going to be uploading mine in the hope that I get to win because I really really want to go to Iceland now that I've had my treat it's time for Lummi to have hers he wanted how much do you want it obviously I'm wearing the sportswear to go to body power because it seems weird if you don't but I've just got my jagged leggings on which I just love the the detailing around the ankle I've got my Chanel trainers a sweaty Betty vest and this is a jumper that is from Topshop by actually customized it because I think I got it too small I got in a petite range which meant it was really short so I just cut it and then my Chanel bag and I've done my signature ponytail so if you want to have a look at this hairstyle I popped a link to this video in the description box as well there's lots of stuff going on in the description box today I just arrived I'm gonna go in the alley and get my pass the dry down on like by myself is really boring but I hope I can find my car as well but let's go find out the other guy can actually talk to you guys like it's quite frustrating what to do is like show you what's going on boom and we just gonna have some lunch and then we're going to head back out at mobile even find some like peanut butter I would advise really really good peanut butter buy the best cleanup I've ever had in my life that's why I'm on high school so ya gonna have to go find okay did somebody get my camera and get my wallet because I just mental exam and I've had a bomb and Buster armor after his birthday cake oven Buster and it's the best thing that I've ever had in my life I literally can't believe this so I came back to get my card cuz I'm going to buy air and I'm going to try the other plate as well and then I'm going to buy the moon as well why not my body power body power so that's it we finished for body power this year what I've already done anything all I've done is walked around and bought peanut butter what is ally doing Andy what are you doing Jane okay um so yeah now we're gonna go and get our cars and head home and hopefully get some food as well because I'm really really hungry I haven't really stopped eating anything my little pipi"	1845

problem we got with the TV this TV goes here okay PS I will put a discount code down below for y'all $50 off but what the TV goes here yeah I think the problem is no no Q let's go get food and a TV and here at Best Buy looking at the TVs because we want to have like a Super Bowl thing with squad and there's so many options I think involved and we're going for 65inch which is pretty big but there's a lot of space so I hopefully it looks like big enough this is the one I think we're getting the whole story hopefully it works trying to find a mouse hey guys I just remembered I did not end this vlog so here I am ending the vlog and I also just wanted to say because I uploaded the vlog before this and a lot of you guys were commenting things wondering why Alex wasn't vlogging as much as he usually does and I'm going to be honest it is because of some of the comments we got from our one of our videos and they were they just really got to him and I don't think that people really realize that the comments do affect us a lot and we take them to heart and when there's a lot of negativity it really really gets especially to Alex cookie is a super sensitive and emotional person which you guys might not know but if I see a negative comment I try to block it out and all Louise Louise Malik I try to block it out sometimes it's hard but for Alex since he is also newer to it it's a little harder for him and so a lot of it got to him and so he hasn't been in the mood to vlog and I totally understand it does kind of sucks because this is like an exciting time we just moved into this house and you know we wants to vlog a lot and I'm trying to do that but it's not as fun without Alex so if you guys want to leave him love in the comments and tell him I know a lot of you guys said that they were like missing Alex in the blog too I just wanted to clarify everything so let him know you'll all love him because he needs some motivation because those comments really just did not sit well with him because he really took them the heart so anyway I think that's it I hope you guys like this moving vlog and I've been vlogging quite a bit in the new house it's only been like a day but get ready for lots of vlogs sorry if they've been a little late also because um sorry my hair's a walk right now sorry they've been a little late because we just got WiFi so that's all set up now and yeah so I love you guys and we'll see you in the next vlog"	1585

fish river canyon overlooking it in the midea and we've stayed two nights in this place cause the fish river lodge beautiful I will show you some footage that I shot yesterday around the area using this guy I got little Ronin it's good I like it it's it was very expensive unfortunately it doesn't fit the c500 on it but it does for the 1bx that's a good start the whole thing fits into my Pelle case but I'm shooting visual rides and the shot that you get from it so it's so fun to use the first Ronin like stabilizer I've ever had today we're leaving where we're leaving to you bub we learned you see our visit campsite oh cool that place is old Germantown oh my god seen that in Louie's videos yeah cool so I'm going to pack up and hit the road but not before we get a bit of breakfast yeah this is this is the view see I mean by us being on top of the columns I don't know how many of these chalets they are and there are I think there's only like 20 it's a beautiful place to come today in the last two days it's been super windy but now there's no wind and it's like a whole nother world it's really cold it's freezing it's winter here I know apparently last night went down to about 1 degree see beyond yes there we went for a cruise we went for a hike all the way along there to that copy just africanus the hilltop or a small hill yeah just like good copy you know I felt like we might be having drone issues on this trip generally this just won't charge up and I can't control the drone without it you know we do have a new drone but I need to get on the internet to register it ok we're finally moving out goodbye fish river canyon as I'm sure it's going to be the case for most of the places we're visiting on this expedition I highly recommend it this is the Ronin in the Pelle case heavy yeah new stickers repping with pride front runner I'm on there I love stickers oh oh okay like it's like okay Mac that's awesome very nice I like it every day yeah that's good yeah that's awesome yeah okay so I didn't mention it already which we definitely have all of our gear on this cars basically frontrunner and it's all amazing and they sponsored it to us which is incredible because you know I would have been buying that anyway quiver guaiba quiver okay this is a koi over tree these trees are called a quiver tree which someone reminded me of in a comment on my Instagram that I posted of Anna Colden equivocally they're beautiful they have this bark on them which I suppose I mean it's waxy so it's top evaporation I suppose so they can hold on to water better didn't realize they got quite so big wow this is horribly overexposed as you realize that whole thing was super overexposed so I apologize you think the side or the back I think I'm thinking the back window or the back across the top bar what do you say yeah you cheese baby you're in charge of the country stickers we've picked a spot the backside window doesn't get looked in anyway because they're the kitchen in the way like oh we can take like four on there Namibia Botswana Zimbabwe Zambia it would be much good sticking stickers on straight to be honest you did a great job baby one down nine to go excess it's not cleaner plane out small town whatever it is it's clean dual battery system manual so you switch this and it puts it back to you the one battery that was been saving and it should start despite the fridge being plugged in the whole time perfect little bit chattery but she cold to sort of self out I can confirm the new drone is working nicely we've got about another two hours of this kind of terrain we're letting it tyres down like 30 seconds each just to soften it up a little bit they are quite hard and we are fully loaded I'd love to know how much my car actually weighs right

"yes_OUR NEW HOME  THE MICHALAKS  #AD.txt"	"desire Oh you could shake our daddy make me the man I am today you know yeah Prince of Eternia Adam I'm you insane town efficient shit enough I hate anybody together too slowly like it off a story like that and oh hello chip sweep of you every left wrist can fry so I think Grayson's got that from you know he loves being scratched from the back yeah in when I put into that tonight he rolled over point up his shirt grabbed my hand and put it on his back through action lesson favorite thing yes I think it's a fiction I think I've got problem yeah there's a Danish word for it I can't me because she's bloody Higgy singer hi Giggy was it called either who got sit down have a black fur blanket on you in chat see mates let me break that book cleaned up let's give everyone a house tour we finished unpacking because I already want to show you that such a mess now I felt like we're making some sort of headway yesterday but then with you like picking up the rest of our stuff today which is just as much as the first load you're on site those two small boxes everywhere cellophane and bubble wrap and Mike things aren't even in the right rooms and it was just like this big manic yeah I mean it's gonna be over in a couple of days and we'll be hassled I feel much better about it now that we've got stuff in notes like the first few nights I felt a bit like a bit scared to go down the road and get a glass of water at night and stuff because it's just a not unfamiliar place when you put your own furniture and plant and pictures and stuff in it it suddenly just feels like home again then I tell you that like when we were moving all of our stuff today there's some opportunists skulking around trying to steal some of the stuff is like whenever the guys were upstairs like in my country at me yeah in London whatever the guys are upstairs with me I was like guys you can't leave our stuff outside for one second something will stay there yeah and they was like that outside asylum like Lux I had to keep reading down and making sure they cave it he's made a little friends are you making and you so happy here is really nice smell that goes breathe in so please normal homeless normal pressure I'm really happy you very tired I'm growing a human and unpacking I think um I ultimately I'm looking forward to get across the hard way tomorrow getting our pump on get that dad what sort out how did dad love the new trend look it's a thing yeah they said I definitely need like the new thing likes what place basically the new sexy no really no I recently about it recently I better written by a guy with a guy pod when he first meets said the king he's quite like and straight away he's quite like let's go and there's a monster in here and the other kids are always a bit like what the hell is this kid and then it takes them a couple minutes and then their base like running entrepreneur monster no they're the best buddies aren't letting room execute teachers icky showing off as a man when you only get chewed you is and Grayson is just watching a little bit of TV set downstairs making us some lunch let me show you how big my bump has got because it is absolutely huge check that out it's properly popped now I look like I'm pregnant in my bum as well Oh Lord the whole reason why we're here right now the whole reason why I was sitting down in this housing bar is thanks to our partner this week I'll start on the top basically a while ago these guys came along and said Mitch lacks if you've got any ideas we'd like to work with you and we came back with the idea that we would move to bath and that would be the idea for to work with his partner and they liked the idea and they said let's go so that's why we're in bath that the partner we talked about is is compared to market calm they specialize in finding really good deals on things like insurance health insurance pet insurance travel insurance broadband deals everything you need to fill out when you leave house yeah so it's not specifically just for people mean we have you need to meet whenever but for us it's like we were changing everything all that wants I don't know when we would have done it if it wasn't for those guys from them because they gave us everything new to do there's no thank you from the bottom of our heart it means a lot and yeah you should go to bed what are we ever not thinking let's go for an early night crusher in the morning don't be too excited about us a few weeks ago I got a letter from the police saying they had impounded my best but and then they send me the photos let me show you the photos if you don't like looking at heartbreaking things I would look away now they've kind of ruined it they've ripped off in on the play they pulled out the electronics yeah it's so painful for me to look at these photos because a Vesper is an extension of yourself sounds really weird thing to say but it feels like a part of you your U of S but you're so United with this thing when you're riding it and you just like buddies you don't really close friends and and then to get these photos and it just being beaten up it's like art hurts that really hurts so I told the insurance company to scrap it so yeah it's gone it's gone forever let's not bring the tone down of the video just keep it on a high let's pull this back with some with a picnic we'll have a picnic in the garden so I had a falafel company I called it just for laughs Oh Oh oh that was really naughty you never ever kicked me in the head like that ever oh because he's racist hey guys I'm going to give you a health tour hallway look tiny plastic Star Wars man there's the dining room it's very actually because we haven't really counted it up they're very like empty right now this is the kitchen and a Bigfoot you have to excuse the mess by the way because we're still unpacking it's taken us like a week to unpack everything I'll show you those the creepy basement just has a death that's just literally going to take forever to organize probably never get touched ah there's a lot of Star Wars man Reddy's come up coming up hover don't fill my shower you're gonna do it with me buddy bathroom it feels really weird it's like an in everyone's kind of moving with us because you will have to get used to it this is staff office it's bit of a space upgrade on the last one this is the noun this room is probably the only room that actually feels like home they star because this is the room with all of our furniture in it and then we have this side of the room as well which we need to get a customers like sofas or something but I think the just looks really cool there anyway and then we're going up another flight of stairs guys I'm not going to like the stairs are a bit of a killer especially when six months pregnant this is probably the most exciting bit of the house for me since the baby's room obviously we haven't done this yet because we have to do the rest of the house and this is probably going to be the last room but we've got the cot ready for Steph's bill and that's not it we need furniture our room is through here don't mind all the crap in the hallway this is our bedroom Steph's mountain of clothes put away over there and then Gracie's your image just through here so all our rings are like right together which is handy I feel like again I feel like this room needs a bit more filling out with something but I'm not quite sure what yet more pictures and walls or something and then and then take you up to my lady office this is my little lady office but the girl is room in the whole house but yeah this is just going to be my little space for editing and writing and like sorting out most London stuff and look at my view it's a pretty nice view for an office isn't it and then just through here we have a spare bedroom which we thought would be really handy for when our families come to say over and when we have friends coming over none of our friends live in bath I think we've got like a handful of people that we know here but most of our friends are in London and not just dust around so we thought it would be really handy to have a spare room some people can actually stay when they come it's a bit of a mission so we need to like get some furniture for this room as well and all the guests are going to eat as confers the top of the pan but yes that's it pretty much isn't it anyways I hope you've enjoyed the quick tour sponsor my exercise of the day you to show you my favorite thing about us I have to climb through this tiny little window though it's worth it let me show you there is no grace to this whatsoever let's probably a technique book I don't take me to yeah don't you come this is my favorite thing about Gracie and I are off to play in the park this morning okay you ready gotta get that tongue yolk in a few weeks from now I'm going to launch on a feed I will need your health because we are competing with some Giants in this market right now and this is just me my mate rich I'm scared about it but I'm also very confident with with our community that we can make it work I need to be so confident that this is going to work in this will work and I think with any idea that you have in life the 99% of it is the person behind that idea that's driving our idea that's what makes it work more than the idea alone you should be launching the next few weeks okay I'll let you know closer to the days when it's actually going to go up but yeah exciting times just casually and some cheese on the right spring what life is all about when you're three why would you laughing in that 50 is going to be a kink and apple crumble hopefully it's going to be edible you can never quite tell with my baking especially when grace is involved grace is in a really bad conky mood the baking not going well well actually I'm just getting on with it and eat please yeah okay when we're moving Willis on this little like gardening herb kicked the kids it's fun it was a personal wardrobe it's like the perfect activity for doses and then it's got little herb feeds and a mini watering calendar mini trowel make that we do it now yes see we have time parsley and sweet basil which one to replant today should plant those seeds and take that long should we go and get some soil for the month welcome our guest on let's get some soil with your leg a fade and this pot let's go get some soil I just walked past myself in the mirror and I come across this place bumper all right let's go get you some more to start and then I see if we water our seeds every single day do you know what might grow out of them honey flowers or hub and then we put the harder than I did yeah let's go find some swirls hmm well done right that's enough things on trees hold up so we've done this one and half of this one and now Grayson's having a tantrum he's having a bit of a Salk's now so I think we're going to give that a rest of today and maybe finish this tomorrow add three year old hey ba ba today on the menu Gracie we have naughty polonaise it's a reinvention cutting my name fine yes she basically in goodbye okay not my dear yes just for my own roll broken dreams about being in this together than that I honestly think there's not a scenario there is no apologies ago I guess you mind you what would you look for strawberries are now challenging you guys welcome to my new little lady pass up here if thanks kepada market that I have my little lady cave and that we've been able to move so quickly we need things like health insurance pet insurance energy and we don't really have the time at the moment to go around looking for good deals so they're going to do all the hard work for us so I'm going to be using now to get us all set up and I think that's going to be using them again and a few months time because I think he was to get another vestra saved anythin for the insurance for that and then maybe hopefully fingers crossed in a couple of years or so we are going to be looking at doing a mortgage that we can use them for that as well anyways please go check them out if you want to see if you can go save yourself some money make fortune guys our journey so much you can tell market working with us this week we've just loved the fact that we've had a thing

these lovely moments we're getting the London Midland train down we always get the train down to London because it's just the easiest thing to do for us but London Midland have some cool things going

number one we're going on London Midland as I've said it's really handy for us because it's direct we don't have to faff around with like driving or traffic jams or worrying about congestion charges

T's and C's so that is linked below if you would like to come and see that and three London Midland currently have a thing called motion which is like you can watch films and team like shows and entertainment and they've got some pretty good titles on there especially for kids they've got secret life of pets and minions and I think they've got Thomas & Friends which made me log his train

see how Doss is getting on with putting her socks on which if you've got a sixyearold you will know that putting socks and shoes on is quite the task and head off and have a lovely lovely day I never

"yes_PREPARING FOR THE BIG DAY"	"good morning guys good morning good morning you join me in like a flower garden in Hove in Brighton I've got something absolutely mindblowing happening tomorrow I don't even know how to describe or tell you what's going on or whether to just leave it for tomorrow and have you wait and find out but I've basically got to get my suit drycleaned for an event that I'm going to tomorrow like oh my gosh literally don't even know I don't know what to say about it it's like the craziest thing that could ever happen to somebody is happening to me tomorrow and I'm

and I'm so excited I'm about to film the next driving challenge and you guys have been going absolutely I might as well just comb this on the beach this clip here let me leave my phone and everything in the car apart down on the beach you can hear me you guys have been going absolutely crazy for these driving challenges they've been so much fun that I'm doing a direct line and it is time for me to shoot the necrons oh I've just handed my shirt and that's tying my suit and everything in I've come down and parked on the beach this is where I'm gonna begin it and today's challenge I'm not going to tell you too much because obviously I don't want to ruin the video but I basically I'm getting given a postcode by and I have no idea where it is I have to drive there and do whatever the thing is when I get there it doesn't really make too much sense and it still doesn't for me because I don't know where I'm going I don't know how long it's gonna take I don't think it's even going to be probably being brightened because she sent post code and not road name and I would know the road name so I have no idea what to expect all I know is I've got my car keys and my car and my camera and everything and we're just gonna have to see what happens you know I'm super proper challenge I don't have a clue what the outcome is going to be so the next clip I'm gonna film for this vlog will probably be probably be after I've done the challenge and I'll let you know how it went I won't tell you too much about it I will leave a link down below the same day as this goes up the driving challenge will go up so go down below show it some labs smash the thumbs up button and just do with the nice things that you guys always do to those videos because you guys are amazing right I'm get back in the car getting in the passenger seat so that I can film the intro and people don't think that I'm filming and driving at the same time because that that is dangerous I'm a little bit nervous I'm excited I'll catch you guys in the vlog in a bit I just got home everybody but I'm not gonna stay how long I need to get to the studio need to go get a film and videos for whilst we're away on holiday I've calculated that I've done six and I think I have seven left to do so many my laptop and everything in there my wash bags and gives me put some hair product in anything else I should probably change into some jeans right let me work so let me get changed and I'll catch you in a bit all right are you ready let's go to the studio look at this everybody it is finally done guys I've been working on this all day it is about to be sent over to direct line this is the new driving challenge look at that four three two done honestly I have no idea when I last blog today it has been absolutely crazy trying to get these videos ready like it's almost like I'm missing out on filming videos today for you guys to watch in this video and content because I'm preparing videos for whilst I'm away I'm about to film a main Channel video with Zoe now everything is set up I just finished filming and editing as you saw the last clip I believe with me sending over the direct line video to diet Lian for them to see well it's been a busy old day guys we're getting there we're getting that it is also can I just say what's shown up to tonight pop is he free its national skateboarding day and national Eva selfie day or celebrities healthy I think it's national I think it's national celebrity skateboard it's not celebrity skirt selfie day oh my gosh right I'm gonna throw this video we're gonna shut out we finished filming up that video now it went so so good and I'm just acting to guard and get some fresh air it was I'm not gonna give anything away except from we're gonna say it was absolutely delicious whatever we did tasted so so good look at the weather guys it is so nice tonight I kind of want to go outside skateboarding its national skateboarding day national celebrity escape I'm Joe hey gorgeous I've hardly seen you today look at your little carrot sleeping with you were you cuddling at your favorite toy have you had a fun day with Zoey yeah give a nice day oh you're so cute did you have a nice day with mummy did you go in a nice walk before me as well did you some people said it's weird to kiss your dog I don't know why I like I suppose I don't I didn't really think about it before I had like my own dog but and dog to me it's just my part of the family it's just like having like a brother or a sister or us by then so I just ordered dinner and I thought there's always said that the food had arrived what was the same come back in here little one don't mind you having a nice nap in here it's strange how when you get a new member of the family a new pet because come over here come and say hello to everybody we're talking about You Missy oh now my food has arrived hey hey thank you so much thank you for the third time as I was saying it is strange when you get a new a new pet a new member of the family because I'm sure before I had a dog myself I probably would have thought that kissing a dog as well would have been strange like it's hairy it's probably dirty it's a dog why are you kissing there but I don't really think about anymore to me like of course Nala is a dog I'm not stupid but she is just part of family aren't you give me kiss give me kisses I suppose there's a little bit different because I've got a pug as well so she's tiny rather than like a massive black wolf for something that some people literally do have although I would love to get a husky one day a husky would be amazing but apparently Huskies need six hours of walk in a day and I don't really have a spare six hours in my day so I don't think I could ever get one I've never really been a fan of like the salads that you get on the sides of dishes I always normally just like leave them or give them somebody else but reason now try and focus on me ensure that I eat them so I have like an agreement with myself that I have to eat all of the salad before I can start my main we just got out of the bath and we're watching breaking the magician's code in bed I don't know if you guys are gonna remember this but it was basically a magic show that shows you how a trick is done comment down below if you remember this and then shows you how the trick is done so it shows you the magic trick and then it show you how it's done afterwards and it's done by this guy with like a mask on his face like a black mask and it never ever told you who's the guy who did it although I just googled it and found out his name was like Val Valentino or something I don't know who he is but he had this creepy ass mask and he was like all black like normally a mask it look more like a balaclava we're like white markings like paint down his face anyways we're watching it on Netflix and I don't know I'm watching it when was that when did this come out when I was bored if we blacked out so I was four would you now to saw a woman in half and then it's bad shows how how it's done it's so oldschool it's not even widescreen it's literally like square go on she's still alive huh but how was it done well we're about to find out how it was done the magic show has just finished and I am absolutely not good like I didn't even I'm sorry another asleep they're both fast asleep I'm gonna hear my vlog now guys don't go to bed I don't know I'm lying at the bottom of the bed it just seemed comfy I'm so excited to be able to say that as you're watching this the driving challenge number four it's live and you guys have shown so much love and support to the previous three like hundreds of thousands of views on every single video thousands of thumbs up and

well which is exciting for one of you thank you for watching this video I really really hope you enjoyed it like I said earlier I'm not gonna make a big thing out of it but I know that the videos for the last couple of days haven't been as entertaining because I've been really really trying to prepare videos for what slow go away including a new main channel video though short like I've prepared so many videos I think of a pet like 11 or 13 or something ridiculous for watch them away I still got a ton of editing stuff to do tomorrow and I got it wrong alia I'm not doing the absolute mindblowing thing tomorrow it's actually happening in one Thursday like it is I don't I don't know if I'm gonna I think I am allowed to say what I'm doing I'm gonna say it and if I get told off I get

"yes_PUMPKINS, PRESENTS & PLONKERS.txt"	"good morning everybody it's Saturday and yesterday we did a kind of team selfie which is lots of the people that we work with both Alfie and myself and then people that we jointly work with we did like a huge kind of summer housewarming like we appreciate you party kind of similar to the one we did at Christmas that time you might have seen it in vlogmas and it was so much fun like honestly it was just one of my favorite days so far this year it was Sports Day themed so we had things like blindfolded wheelbarrow obstacle courses and we had one team which was my team and then we have one team which was alphas team and we picked names out of a hat so it was very mixed and like a really good way of everyone kind of coming together and kind of I don't know it's just it was so nice this is the like remnants this is after we've cleared up this morning but we rented another stretch tent we got a bigger one of these when we had our friends and family over for the housewarming but we thought it would be nice to have a smaller one because there wasn't as many of us and we had a bar and we had like sports day cocktails like themed cocktails like one of the cocktails is actually in a like sack like a sack race cocktail it was amazing as a really fun day and I haven't done things like that since like honestly I think since I was actually in school so I must have been well I didn't really do sports day in secondary school I'm not gonna lie our tutor group was awful because none of us wanted to do it there was always a very like sporty tutor groups that would get really involved in sports day and ours just we never did in fact I think I did a couple of Sprint's and that was it but the last time I properly did sports day I was probably like 10 11 so it's been a very very long time but I think everyone had an amazing day and it was a real success we had somebody that cooked meal for us so we had our dinner out here I was like also this like cute little area where we sat and had like canapes and drinks Alfie and Sean got this fire pit out last but we didn't actually use it so we've just got that there and this was the board teams Alfie sport State Board and on the other side you can see who won team Alfie won a threelegged eggandspoon we won the tights on the head game I'm about that game was amazing sack race Alfie's team won donut hoopla Alfie's team got 200 and we got wheelbarrow race we won rounders they smashed rounders like they lost count of how many points they got which really tipped them over the edge and then we did a Southie quiz where alphas team got 600 and mine team got 1200 so in the end Alfie won and our team came second but the quiz was so funny it was all questions about like me and I'll feel at how many times did I take my driving test whose childhood teddy is whose overall it was just one of the best days and I really hope everyone had a good time I think they did we went to bed really late last night and then woke up really early this morning because we needed to clear the kitchen was an absolute state like out here was an absolute state so me and after you've been like running around this morning like headless chickens trying to tidy up because this weekend we have Tanya and Jim coming to stay they haven't actually properly stayed at this house yeah so this is like their first time like really experiencing the house I think I'm really really excited to them to come I've actually had a really bad headache this morning I've just taken some tablets so they should be arriving in around 45 minutes and we are going to go going to go we are going to go pumpkin picking with tinyg and poppy and Shaun and I am so excited because we went last year you may have seen my blog post but we actually went too late there was no pumpkins to pick it was just all the ones that already been picked and the season had kind of gone so we managed to get a few little squashes which actually they're my favourite thing to get anyway but we didn't manage to actually cut off any giant like carving pumpkins so hopefully when we go there's gonna be a few more field I think I went a bit overboard on the trees just slightly I got I got carried away online shopping this isn't all for like this weekend it's just for us to like nibble on it it's just for today but look they have all they're like Halloweeny trees I did get some festive friends but only because they're delicious and some trees let's please look so good white chocolate coated biscuit balls YUM these are always amazing gory and grizzly chocolate pumpkins and then look they had these goosed goose eggs so what some those Tara stop orange cuz you can never go wrong no no no goosed oh yeah they're like um cream eggs but like ghost eggs and then look at these harrybo harrybo's scare mix I just got carried away guys you know I get like sour stripes I just like the sound of those pumpkin patch cakes yes Maryland cookie bites mini Cheddar's snowy fingers and a little ginger some lunch pudding because it just sounded really good I'm just now trying to edit the vlog from Alfie's birthday because I completely forgot this week that I needed to edit so I was like I need to do that today so I can put it up later oh yeah they do I'm so stylish these are Alfie sliders I just put them on so I could show them everything outside pumpkin picking Tanya and Jim coming to stay treats all this time we were warty dick picking no it was all the old Louis marrows and like squashes like yeah but I like the squashes I think they're really autumnal we'll see what we can get but we should probably take do you have a little penknife or anything because to cut the pumpkins off you need to take your own life okay my raybans looks a lot like that it's always the ones that you use and love the most yeah I find what we can do our food oh I need to reel reapply I didn't bring my sunglasses oh god you're screwed you're gonna get us a watery eyes oh right I'm so excited about this and we have like the best weather for it yeah I'm screwed bury me in it I think it's the one I jump out to everyone I'm

really like annoying he's like that's a pumpkin not our pumpkins are we've managed to get our pumpkins to here but they're very heavy aren't they very heavy pumpkins the boys have rolled them and then we're going to come back for them and then I think we should probably get on the tractor to get back yeah yeah we're now in the raspberries but it is hot so hot we're like picking pumpkins for autumn and it's actually a really sunny day I think maybe raspberry season is just about out but we're trying to find the little squashes you know the ones that look like baby pumpkins with like loads of different colors in we can't seem to find any I don't know where those would be I think maybe we just went past them Tan's been naughty in eating them you are a rebel Tanya burr well if you go to jail for eating raspberries pick your own outrageous got the boys carrying carrying the pumpkins yay look at them all in a line all on your shoulders we didn't quite think it through so he found the biggest pumpkins we could find and then realized we still have to walk back to the car yeah the woman did say on our way in this lady had this massive one she was like oh the walk back to the car wasn't fun and we were like ha ha ha and now the boys are all walking the pump kit in the walk what I'm gonna say to someone else by the way guys all that wasn't fun they're gonna go yeah I know and then they're gonna do it I can't lift my arm by the way this filming angle is probably not the most flattering but I can't lift my arm because I've got a squash on it ok and Tanner in the squash field

should have his phone oh my god yes the greenhouse you guys for the blood bucket shreds make sure you sit in the feet bit Hey yes pin us no don't spin Jim farewell my friends there we go put your hands up first like call out hands at yeah there you go nice whilst the boys are downstairs eating ice pops and trying to chill out I thought would be a nice time for me to sneak away and to tell you about an app that I've actually been using and loving now for around two years and they contacted me recently and I was more than happy to work with them on this because it's something that I already use and already loved and already want to show you guys because it's amazing it's an app called clue and I already know that a lot of you use it and I honestly recommend this to everybody I know I made papi get it I actually have her as a friend on it so we can track each other's periods which sounds crazy but it's so useful you don't believe me there you go I'm sure she doesn't mind me saying this but I actually made her come on because that's what happens with females you hang around a lot you're in sync and that's exactly what happened if you don't know what clue is it is an app to track your menstrual cycle but not just that it's also tells you the days that you are most fertile and you can track your moods your sleep patterns your skin so I've actually been putting this in and very detailed for a very long time and honestly I love it I don't just love it because it can like remind you when you're due on and it kind of explains things also but I really like that it traces the different patterns so when I'm feeling particularly emotional or stressed I will put that in as like PMS and then it kind of contains all that information and will then tell you like you're going to be PMSing next week or with my headaches so yesterday I knew my headache was related to my period because whenever I come on I always have really really awful headaches and sometimes I'd be like why have I got such bad headache if they haven't drunk enough like how I've been staring at screen for too long today you don't need to go get my eyes checked and I can literally look at my phone and be like nope because I track headaches the first couple of days or the day before my period every single month and then it kind of reminds me and it makes complete sense um so for any of you that want to track your period but also it predicts your next one or you just like being able to track things like that like the amount of sleep you have and how much that can like differ during the month and all those all those insightful details I really really like it for that and also the more things you track the more accurate their predictions can be for your next period so if we look at my last one because we're all friends here you will see if I touch this open I tracked at the start heavy this was my pain so I've got cramps and a headache C headache every time and I always forget I tracked my emotion as sensitive sleep as 69 hours my sleep never really varies my energy was low my mental state was distracted and you can pick which ones you want so if some of them don't apply to you then you don't have to have them now I already use this app and so being able to tell you about it was an absolute nobrainer because I love it and I recommend it to absolutely everybody I wish I'd had this when I was younger because I would get so worried and be like why why is my period not starting I don't know I've forgotten when it's supposed to start and if I'd had this app the whole time I think it would have taught me a lot and it would have made more sense and I don't know I just really really liked it I use it every month so if you like the sound of that and you also think it might be good for you then you can download the app for free from the App Store and also Google Play and I will leave a link in the description box so you can go on over and click that and download it let's see if the boys have cooled down we're going to the garden center now why you sat on the floor you look like you're Oh Joey's got a book signing today yeah is it anyone at Waterstones at a bit Smith

"yes_SEEING MY WALK IN WARDROBE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER"	"good morning welcome to move number four now I'm just in the best mood because I'm like on my g7 a lot to my babies back from repair I have put a screen protector on it I've put a cover on it I I'm not having this camera break again okay I've taken precautions I'm not actually in bed I'm just laying on my bed because I am going to get stuff done I've actually been up and out already this woman to put my sister up and now it's time to get ready for the day and then we are going to commence the moving today something exciting is happening my like wardrobes were finished and I actually haven't been allowed to see them yet because they weren't finished and mum was like um just have a big reveal just don't look at them till they're done and I was like okay okay I won't so I've seen like one or two snippet kind of pictures like closeups but I have not seen in the room anything like that so I'm moving on my clothes and today into a space that I don't even know what it looks like yet so we're gonna do a big reveal which is very exciting and yeah we should have a ton of sauce too but I'm gonna put on a little bear makeup today so let's go ahead and see what I've actually got left here this room it looks so okay well it's like my super it's empty like it's looking very empty so yeah let's go put some makeup on and then we'll get on with the day so I'm back I just did my makeup on insta life now I don't know you can tell it's a super kind of natural glow everyday look that I'm gonna kind of turn up with some lipstick so I've got 12 shades here of beat one it's all the shades of the Bourjois Rouge velvet the lipsticks please ignore my gross nails it's Sunday so I always redo them on a Sunday but I've got 12 of these lipsticks so there's like corals pinks reds or like this gorgeous kind of deep ready Brown that's like really fun so I've got bright red trousers like trying to feel like I should go for a red um they're like superbright longlasting though they're like not bright that's from the wrong word they're bold colors but they're supposed to last it's 24 out song gonna do a little like test today see if they do I think I may go for this one this is Ruby's cute I mean I think that matches my chokers oh I don't know which one I think I like this one but it really is cute yeah there's like 12 of them all different ones but I love them this kind of pinky color I'm all about pinks that are like almost nudes but Pink's so yeah these are supposed to be like super super cultural on the lip almost like kind of a second skin if that makes sense instead of being like a lipstick that's like drying but it's still matte so I'm gonna use the maracas contour lip primer and I'm gonna pop this actually all over my lips to create a kind of base between my lips and the product and this is just like a clay primer I'm kind of tempted to go for the pink because I love the pink but I can't really wear pink from wearing red trousers Oh No well go for a red red spun so this is Ruby's cute number eight I percent they're twelve now they've got this awesome shape bullet which is gonna make application so easy well I mean I'm assuming I use a lot of lipstick so from seeing this I think this is gonna be a winner it just if you look it looks like it they like to sit on the lip so let's apply this red and see how it goes it's so smooth I love the fact it like sits on the lip I don't know like that makes sense it like just sit it's always like I just have to swipe Wow and the small side just fits and I keep it's like now he's acting mad I'm almost like why do brands bother doing like the pointed bullet because this is so easy this is the final makeup look it's really fun really simple with a pop of color which matches my joggers so yeah going for that extra look um but we will see how this lasts I mean is applied really nicely feels really smooth like but not like not like it's gonna move like feels like it's gonna stay but it doesn't feel dry yet I mean it could could go dry I don't know we'll see but I'm liking how it looks right now so I guess it's time for me to grab my bits and then head off to so this is the progress far I've got this is all stuff at my drawer select pajamas and stuff so yeah we've got them so pretty much these drawers except these two are empty so that's good that's progress I just don't you know I'm gonna do this hello oh gosh okay get to good boy sit I don't know they're gonna fight now you're gonna fight now should we get some food updates it feels like it's been like 30 seconds juice actually been about an hour and a half to me and I have been unloading like almost of my room pack it into boxes are putting in the cart in suitcases I've got like five suitcases full right now I'm gonna have some food then go like drive all the way to my place unload it come back get another load lip update it feels like it's set I feel like house like kiss something there's like nothing there so yeah but it's not drying like I don't feel like I'm like like sometimes Jim matte lipsticks but it just feels like it's set it's really it's really odd sensation that normally one her we're like liquid lipsticks or matte lipsticks I'm I feel like I can't smile and I'm like and I'm not I feel like I've got like resting face but so that's great and I'm gonna eat so we'll do the taste test see if it can handle the food but I don't actually know what to eat I just you know and even like you're eating just because you know you need energy and you need food that's where I'm at right now so I've just finished my lunch and here is the lip up deck so it feels like smoother again if that me says I had cheese so it's like probably like the oil from like the cheese or like the butter or whatever but yeah it's not come on which is crazy and it's right like it doesn't feel like bTW or anything like so it just feels like more bombing but maybe it'll set down again that'll be cool if it like sets down again how it did so well let you know BRB just um heading out with half my life in my car you know just as you do so I'm here and the mammoth task of bringing all my stuff in is about to begin but I want to see my water so there's a buck um I shut the door so I couldn't say but oh my god I didn't even shut my eyes a lot oh my god I'm gonna actually gonna cry is that what adrenaline centers like so little oh it wouldn't like that little but like since I was younger looks like dude oh my gosh this is crazy obviously I like designed them all and stuff but like oh let me just so this is my dressing room how crazy this space of my jewelry my clothes it's like so much hanging I also have hanging for my long like ball gown dresses because I have five or six of those I've got like shoe shelves bag shelves boot space like a like a baby so this is all IKEA packs unit I don't know whether it my top starter so like I've built them all in not I didn't build that was long building for me but I picked them all individually then you pick like if you wanna hang rails I wanted double hanging on most of these just because that's what I need and I kind of fit it into the room by doing it in the corner and then I had them fitted and they've got it fitted them so talented like what he does so he put these bits in for me like mom told me about these they're like fitters so it makes like they don't come from I care or anything but it makes that bit a bit annoying but we're Signori it makes them look like fitted wardrobes my rooms actually like like that so he put like this thing it's just hollow behind that and I've got shelves over at the top like my bag boxes yeah I'm just like I don't also OTD Justin Bieber purpose tour joggers from H&M slipon vans and this top from H&M which I actually cut because I didn't have any of the crop tops and I never wear this so I just cut it with some scissors earlier so and my lips are still holding up these are been on for like well I think I must have messed the timing up but these have been on for a good three four hours now and it's very good so I'm really happy well I mean they claims you 24 hours so we'll sit right all this is in I was gonna unpack it but there's no point so I'm just gonna go grab my other stuff and then come back back and I've got another carful I'll show you actually by Jonesy lipstick updates been another about hour and a half and it doesn't look any different I'm sorry these updates is so boring because it leaves it the same I mean it's gone for down a bit lesser size at the bottom here but I sit so let me show you I've got my car look at all this yeah my whole wardrobe you I I don't even know how I'm here right now uh no um this is pretty much most of my clothing that was hanging before so you know I have more space which is amazing but then I have all the clothes in boxes that we actually brought in here so pros and cons pros and cons but we should be fine I mean it's all a mess right now and I have some my long dresses so they shouldn't be about yeah I just get sorted in time to pack for Paris so oh my gosh so we're getting there it's taken a long time and yeah you know it's starting to come together I saw so much stuff like but I mean you saw all that previously like my coats not hung up I just have so much stuff it's like daunting it's make stuff I don't have places for what I don't know where to put it but I've got my long dresses there shoes bags down there so it's going good and I'm just putting my boxes at the top along there so judging probably hair I've got the windows wide open but yeah my makeups holding up considering I'm like so sweaty but lip update it's looking really good I'm actually so shocked there's still on after I ate and I've been drinking constantly it's like slightly kind of hair as you can see but that's over just shut my office moni can't tell so that's mad and the colour still just as bold just as vibrant so soon good so I'm currently in why I don't want to call this room I think I'll just call it my glam room because it's just where I'm gonna be getting ready in the morning it's not just me to get ready in but it's a we're we're getting ready so we'll just call it my grandma room just even know what I'm talking about I've been empty more what its involved in too busy storage and now I'm going to empty my makeup into like my makeup drawer so I might get ready and stuff yeah how does so much stuff everywhere it's just stuff it's not even like oh I don't know where it's supposed to go like today feels like the most drastic moving day just because like what clothes it in and stuff like that like it's mad I still have a ton of sorted answer in my clothes I have so many clothes that like I've just kept because I'm like I'll wear it one day and I just have it no no I won't but I just can't get rid of it I'm such like a sentimental person that like say I feel like dude just like I don't know it wasn't a special occasion I'll get rid of it but not even like special occasions in my christening or a wedding as in like I saw McFly perform you know that kind of thing she's really bad but yeah lots and lots of unboxing and unpacking I have so much storage in here which is that so my parents have just gone and left me alone like the first time like this is my first night here without them so crazy I'm just getting through the last of the bit so I'm putting away but I mean it's going good I did have a bit of a crisis I just ran out of internet and my WiFi doesn't get installed for a while so I was literally like out of contact with everyone from about 10 minutes I rang my mom was like the o2 website I had to add like a bolton on for like it's a mixture into that because I've been out and about a lot this one I got through 20 gigabytes this month 20 gigabytes how mad is that I just started this series of Netflix so I'm probably gonna use all this up as well because I'm watching Netflix but you know I've ordered some food and yeah I was gonna buy and go and buy food but it's Sunday so everyone show up firstly and secondly I go to power someone says there's like no point in having fresh food in the house so yeah I'm just gonna continue to unpack I think I'm doing pretty well and then gonna eat one piece hello so it's about oh my goodness half 10 I've just been at it constantly like putting stuff away sorting out all my everyday makeup is away now let me give you a little look so this is how we are looking it's yeah very full I need to kind of sort it out but pretty much like most of what I was trying to get done I've got done I still need to sort like my clothes out and everything everything is just very muddled I need to organize it like categories then colors within categories because that's how I do things this is how we're looking right now so everything's there there are my summer clothes they need to go somewhere else but yeah it's just a bit of a mess but it's so nice to have space I can't so when I lived at my parents house I had like probably the amount of wardrobe space that like two of these would give so like yeah four high areas but that included space in like a spare room so I had all my jackets in the spare room wardrobe and it was just a bit of a mess so and then my accessories I just because what I do part of what I do is like fashion so it's not not like I bought loads of it just because you know I wanted I fancy getting some new clothes a lot of the things of like events and things like that so yeah I kind of needed them so yeah it's just a bit mental really I'm so excited to have like this room and be able to kind of sort this out if you would like a full wardrobe kind of told like I don't know what's called resting around or maybe when I am finished please do let me know but for now I'm gonna leave you with um his lip update it I ate again I had pizza as you see it's come off just here and here but besides that let me turn to the light so you can actually see it's perfect so like I would if I were to go out I probably wouldn't bother chopping this up I would just walk out of the house I think that says a lot we've done really good the lipstick has performed extremely well and it got a hundred percent hold up longer so yeah and this was with no topups bear in mind like I know some people are really keen on like topping up their makeup and their lipstick I just don't have that in me I just don't not like are we bothered it's just not it's a bit fussy and I'm not fussy persons they suit me really well and still like look no marks but I'm gonna love you and leave you thank you so much for joining me with this moving vlog we're almost there which is so exciting I could not be happier but I ready to have a bath I'm going to bed so yeah thanks actually joining me and I'll see you very very soon good"	3281

"yes_The Sister Day Vlog  AD  ViviannaDoesVlogging.txt"	"hi everyone I hope you all well it is ridiculously early in the morning Marcus is making breakfast but the today's vlog is gonna be a little bit different firstly because I normally vlog like wookie style but this look is just gonna be of today because I've got very exciting day planned and secondly because I partnered up with Kinder Bueno on this video to do their try a bit of different challenge and I'm basically going to do exactly that so I'm going to do something later data is completely out of my comfort zone like how I'm trying to like around poppy anticipation even though you guys have obviously seen the thumb they're one of the best days about work on kinder Wayne is that you have to try the product a little bit to check this out a lovely box full where no got some white chocolate ones in there got some milk chocolate ones in there this box is obviously a bit more full but what can I say I'm a bit of a fan then why can I have very different tastes when it comes to chocolate bars is actually one of the few that we agree on we like it I mean fun to use but we don't agree on how to eat it know how do you eat it just like chunk it down jump it whereas I like to take off the wafer and then like scoop out the hazelnut Center and whenever I eat it mark is just like shake you and you team Chomp buddy team scoop Dijon so much just having a toast and then he'll be off to work and I'm actually off to the gym so leave it probably already guessed from the thumbnail but today I'm going gokarting and I am so excited I've always wanted to go gokarting like years and years and years just never had the opportunity so very excited for today and I'm just massively into driving at the moment I already passed my test like two years ago I learnt when I was 17 but I felt good test three times it ended with me mounting a roundabout and obviously failing my third and final one I was like no that is it so it was only a couple years ago I took it back up again like really to learn to pass and now I'm just hugely into driving so what better time to have like a driving experience day gokarting extravaganza I'm probably the thing I'm most excited about is that I'm actually doing it with my sister she's actually always wanted to go gokarting as well she got a rest day so I was like yeah why not let's have a little sister day out like normally we just go to the gym I'll go around each other's houses to be quite fun to do an actual day like go to someone with her and of course isn't going to be a bit of a sister competition of course we're naturally competitive with sisters it's interesting Megan's definitely more of the badass one out of the two of us like she is well hard if you follow her on Instagram you'll know that she's really into like fitness she's really strong she's a bit of a badass but she is so slow at driving we call her the turtle and I I'm really I'm crossing my fingers I

go and then he said those something you use this really fancy word but there's something in the wheel thing where when you turn right in a car off one of the wheels will slow down like as you turn

"yes_THE STRUGGLE IS REAL  AD  Lily Pebbles Vlog.txt"	"good morning everyone I've woken up in a beautiful hotel room because I was at an event last night with Anna Ruth and Caroline we had such a hilarious evening I've worked not very happy and feeling really refreshed also really liking my makeup I've been trying really hard to do extra glowy makeup recently because my skin's been so dry so I might do a little video soon on this if I can kind of perfect it I'm actually now checking out my doors opens and I'm really aware that everyone can hear was lost and let me just close that I'm actually now checking out of the room me and Anna have a really fun day together we are going to record the podcast at Glamour magazine so their podcast which is called hey it's okay Joe Alvin and I think a couple of other people are going to be chatting to us we have no idea what it's about what we're going to be talking about or anything so I'm just going to have to get better I like thinking on the spot and chatting but hopefully that'd be really nice and then we're going to interview Georgie Keys who is the founder of Ostia we tweeted last night's ask you guys who had these skincare questions for her she is so great I can't wait Anna but she never met her I love her I met her a couple of times so I'm really excited to see her how so I'm going to bring you guys with me today got my suitcase and I think I'm ready to go it's such a beautiful sunny day like really really warm I love it it makes me so happy we actually took achieve and it convinced me not getting but which meant that we've got how much quicker so we're taking our time and we're wandering down the planner haven't said hi to you on a vlog yet hi who wrote very well rested the beds last night was so complete so we're going to wander down to grammar and we'll stop vlogging because there's a group of builders they lost we didn't oh no I thought most Neer's vogue house which reaches the glamorous we're hoping area I think it is so we're going to go in here if we can find you we need to fine so we're now in the glamour offices Joe's here hello hi and look at this mess up it's a standing situation yeah I mean I feel like I'm going to pretend to be like a radio person with this there's no sense that's the best real capital part it's very closest we finished at glamour and it was so good on so like quick and the ANA spent like a welloiled machine they know exactly what they're doing there and Joe is such approach you just like start talking then Azam through it was really fun I really enjoyed that we're now picking up some flowers for our podcast guests we're going to pick some kind of houses afternoon and we've got a little bit of time so they were going to grab some lunch as well flowers and liberty are insane they're so beautiful let me show you look at seeing oh my god and then over here they saw all the pretty pink on its work some celebrity just to look at the flowers places and our precision I can't believe I'm saying this after last week's vlog fine bat kuv I feel like I come here all the time because it's such a convenient location for about the circus so we're going to have cooking out some sushi for lunch and look at it head to Georgie's huh we finished recording a podcast Georgie and yes own I and what do business I do nice one of us is there like competing to see who's going to get an adverse user hits on you know they're going to get them in the podcast amelong I'm home again and I'm back at my desk so weird I haven't had hay fever all day and I've just walked into my flat used washing and suddenly I have terrible hay fever so does that mean I'm like allergic to my flat I don't really understand how that works but we had a really successful day lots of talking like podcasts are just so chassis I've got a little bit of work to do before it's like 10:00 to 5:00 those want to quickly set up some emails before everyone like leaves their office and then I'm going to make dinner for me and rich and I'm making them a delusional curry again in such a coincidence when I vlog on days I do the same things as I did last week I guess that's like real life though isn't it rich to the food shop while I was away last night and apparently tonight we're having curry okay I've done my emails for the day well I'm going to quickly show you guys because I just received something in the post that I'm pretty excited about as you guys know is late I talk about it all the time if you've watched me for years and you would have seen the original video that I did with my friend Keisha when she got me into epilating before I'd tried waxing laser shaving I kind of tried it all as a very hairy girl that has been hairy since I was like a young teen I feel like I've literally tried it all and I just really enjoy epilating I find it's really convenient for me this is about the booking appointments that I have to go get waxed and also just mainly it just works really well for me it's mainly results driven that's why I do it I just find that the hair grows back so much slower and not all at one so it's much easier to maintain and it was just a sunny day and I want to just throw on a dress I can pretty much guarantee that my legs are going to be in a good condition whereas when I used to shave it it was just glad I would always have stubble it was a bit of a nightmare I really don't find epilating hurts you get so used to it it's like the first couple of times it's a little bit of a shock and then you really do get used to the feeling it's actually quite satisfying I find what you used to it I know that sounds crazy is plate my legs and my arms not because I don't think that girls should have hairy arms at all I did for 28 years of my life or something I just prefer it I like the feeling of my arms but as I said I don't have to keep up with it all the time at the moment I haven't escalated my arms for 3 weeks maybe and there's like hardly anything there and a few fine heads are there are so exciting it's not stubbly or anything it still feels really smooth that's exactly why I like epilating anyway you won't have a new epilator out and they sentence me and I'm going to unbox it to you quickly in the slog so it's a broad silk apple and it's a skin spa version so this and what's going on in this escalator said it's a foreign one but basically it comes that all these removable heads do so many different things so I'm going to unbox it and show you guys so it comes with the charging point I always get like a plug adapter if you don't have a shader plug in your bathroom you can just get the adapters on Amazon and plug into a normal plug this little brush cleans it I always lose mine so I'm happy to have another one so this is the epilator it's really like lightweight ready for sound I swear it sounds scarier than it feels so it comes with the standard like epilating head I really like this because it's quite wide also it like moves around which is good around your knee joint comes with two exfoliating brushes one like a bit more firm than the other I really like to use these in the shower before I'm going to fake tan just realize that you might get sued on my dress I always use these on my legs around like my knees and my ankles just really exfoliate skin and get smooth before tanning it's really good because you get this little like head and you just clip on that clip it on the escalator and you can use it wet or dry so you can use it in the shower I like to use it kind of on damp skin but not in the shower like what I've just got out the shower and then they've also got this new one which I haven't tried yet and it's like a rubbery head and this is a deep massage head so it like will stimulate blood circulation and your leg I'm really looking forward to trying this one actually so that's got everything you get all these like bits and bobs and like just heads themselves for those are the three main that pay so I'm going to talk you through today I don't know if you guys are going to want to actually see me epilate but I'm going to do my legs and arms tonight because it's actually really sunny tomorrow and I want to wear a summer dress so it's so easy that I can just do it now in like 10 minutes before I cook dinner maybe I ought to show you a bit of me doing my arms just so you can see that it really doesn't hurt okay I'm up here I'm going to quickly do some of my arms and then I'm going to do it properly tonight when I'm in the shower it's so quick okay none of that I'm always trying to convert my friend to escalate him I'm so glad that my friend Keisha got me onto it that video is so old but it's quite funny so I'll link it okay if you want to grab a watch all along international team to forget about yourself wondering how food comes around I didn't call for vegetarian path change Rich's cook to the right in our magic writers I hear that I love some magical hardly enjoyable past obsess and I just finished the chlorine pretty sure the cause of all cooked through now it smells so good I just got my little notebook out cuz I'm going to prep for a video I do have tomorrow I haven't got video Sunday I just suddenly came up the idea today but I have no idea if it's gonna be any good or not so I'm just going to write it down and see if it's gonna be a good enough idea for a video which is just watching football I just realized that it's 11 o'clock about to go to bed I have an unpacked since last night work so I'm going to do that now I'm going to finish vlogging for today and I think I'm going to vlog so it's Tuesday now and I think I'm gonna vlog on some day so I pretty much got a whole week until I speak to you guys again I've got lots of videos to film between now and then Father's Day on Sunday I must get my dad something not sure what to get someone who doesn't want anything I'll see you guys on Sunday good morning everyone it is Sunday and it's been a while since I spoke to you last time I had a whole week of work on Friday Anna and I recorded another podcast it was really good yesterday I went all finding that work suffered so the whole of Saturday and stuff aware which family are from and then today it is Father's Day it's going to be so hot like almost 30 degrees it's been crazy hot recently so I put my hair up because it needs to be washed anyway I've hardly put any makeup on and we're going to my parents house for a barbecue I think there's also going to be sorry that's the washing machine making loads of noise I think we going to have tapping pool and sprinkler and the kids are going to be like in a cynical stoom so I've also put my swimming costume on because it's Sunday and I actually forgot I was vlogging so now I'm like going any to blog when I'm looking rough but it's going to be really fun I don't know how much of today I can film but first thing I'm doing this morning is going for a walk with my friend Hannah we always like to catch up it's a breakfast we'll go to walk to something like that so we're going to go for a little walk we are walking around my local area there so I can't vlog it but I will come back to you guys when we're back from our walk we need to eat something first banana we're filling up the paddling pool got blankets on the go hi guys sorry that I have been absolute failure of a vlogger today ah my hay fever has been so so bad I just put in like these are cotton wool pads as soaked in cold water on my eyes because they hurt so much I've had really bad hay fever since I was about 18 and if you don't get he fever I think you realize how bad is like my throat feels like what knives that makes wrote like a can't stop sneezing continuously in my eyes today I've been burning so much and so it's been really hard to kind of concentrate on anything else I went to my parents house and we had a barbecue and we played in the paddling pool which was really nice it was so fun to be around all the kids but it's just it was hard to my blog and stuff as well because I just couldn't take my wine I couldn't concentrate anything I feel so like bummed up in my face on the way back from my parents we popped in to my friends Gemma and Ben and we had we'd like catch up and have a drink we'll end up staying for dinner and getting sushi that always happens when we go to see them sorry I just needs like cities are my item in it I've been a terrible vlogger today but you haven't really miss much it's been so so hot I know in the UK we complain when it's raining and we complain when it's hot but it's so hot at the moment there's like no breeze at all but it's also been quite nice to get some Sun anyway well so I have to tell you rich and I have been watching love island I've never watched it before every year I see people tweeting about it but I've never watched it and we started watching it this year it's like really bad but it's really good at the same time like it's kind of addictive so we're going to watch that tonight and that's kind of all I've got to update you on so sorry today has been a bit of a no vlog thank you guys for watching this vlog and I'll see you my next video which will be on Sunday I'll see you then guys"	2849
"yes_The Sunset Relay Vlog  Lydia Elise Millen  ad.txt"	"good morning guys it's about 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning and Ali and I've just finished packing because we're heading to Sweden today we are going to be taking part in the sunset relay which is in Lapland and it's organized by Garnier and the European Cancer League and it's basically just to raise awareness about the damage Sun can do to your skin and protecting yourself accordingly so we are heading out there first we've got two flights to get and you guys are going to come along with us well this is definitely a different look for me there's no Gucci bags or Balenciaga bags and certainly no makeup I am carrying this massive thing on my back and I think it weighs more than me I'm also wearing my tshirt that was given to me by a lovely group of guys when I was at body power and it says love sport beat racism and I just think it is a great cause and it's really comfortable too I'm also wearing my new adidas trainers which I'm going to be running in during the race but they're super comfortable so it seems silly not to travel in them we've arrived at Heathrow I think we're running a little bit late so we're going to go and take it in and then hopefully spend the money in dutyfree so we just had the most distressful checkin at and as possible expires next one and they last travel they said that we needed three months and we did double check and luckily they've let us fly but we only have like minutes to spare so we're going to head to a flight now so we just landed in Stockholm and we are trying to find our next slide to Karuna and we have no idea where we are so we're just gonna walk around until we find it you and we finally landed in Kiruna it's o'clock at night and it's still broad daylight it's very green and I thought it's gonna be like England but this is nothing like England it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning and it's still light outside we've just reached our hotel and had a sandwich and now we're going to try and get some sleep because we've got to be up about five five vanity to leave such a beautiful place behind tired good morning everyone is about 5:30 in the morning it's still light outside and we're about to go downstairs I think that the bus is Natalie and we're going to head up to where the race is going on and to show you all of the action and then I think tomorrow is when I'll be running my leg and tomorrow morning is when Ali will be doing his Tuesday stay tuned we've had about four hours sleep and we've just stopped out to have some lunch I've been asleep most of the time on the bus to try and catch up but Ali's going to be racing tonight this is the bus that most people are sleeping on but I think tonight I'll be going back to going back to a hotel to stay in lucky me because I'm not racing in till 5: hi everyone so been a bit of a tiring day I'm still tired I still haven't got enough sleep I've been quite an experience so far we've been on a bus everyone's sleeping or rushing around I've come to a really nice hotel to get some sleep before I raised tomorrow at p.m. and I will see you in the morning Ali's about to do his second second part of the relay but we're gonna get some food you okay so I am waiting to go and run my leg at the race I've got about minutes left so I'm gonna have a coffee for my preworkout as I would normally have and then I'm running with two other girls so Ali's going to take over the camera from now and hopefully hopefully he will get some good footage if not I'll kick in tired Tyron i've got so sorry for them they weren't so sorry to me good day yeah stick it like you had a good run and I the fact I finished was I was fighting a stitch from like the third the third kilometer and like I thought oh my god because usually I just stop if I get stitch but I did that thing that you Toby's do yeah and I lifted my arm up and then step my foot and it didn't get it got rid of it but I can still feel it but I made it six months myself six kilometers that's the most I've ever fun oh good excellent just get some drink yeah Eastern water they even asked someone when we were running like so we were back the hotel it was really nice that I had a shower and then we all run the last little bit of the relay together and now they're having a beber party in the middle of the street which is pretty amazing and that's what you can use we're going to show you that now you and finally we are at the last hotel that we will stay in tonight is really really nice it's a bit dark because we can't work out how to turn on the lights but we've got bathrobes which seeing as we feel so disgusting I cannot wait to snuggle in morning everyone so me and Ally got back late last night and this morning we've unpacked and had a shower had a bit of a refresh but well what a journey we have had in Sweden it was amazing spending four whole days in daylight was the most real experience taking part in such an amazing race over kilometers I can't I just can't believe that we had that opportunity it doesn't feel real it doesn't feel like it happened to us we're both just so amazed that we got to take part and we're so inspired as well I really want to to work more on getting better at running and doing it a lot more because I was surrounded by athletes that like run 70k in their spare time and that's amazing the endurance that their bodies can can withstand and their constant motivation they're just ready to go all the times if someone was was injured they were happy so to take over and just do their leg without even thinking about it and that was just so inspirational especially for someone like me because I was totally out of my comfort zone and yeah it was it's just I feel totally inspired and so motivated and to have done it for such a good cause as well I'm a big factor 50 wearer so spreading awareness about sun damage is really really important and especially at this time of year it's boiling in England so yeah it's it's just been such a surreal experience and we're both just so thankful to have taken part and I really really hope you've enjoyed watching my first vlog and I hope you enjoyed coming along with me to Sweden and I'm just excited to show you more so stay tuned for the other blog posts as well"	1322

morning and I'm really excited actually we bought this current mattress on the day that we got engaged so that was like when was that August 2000 what August 14th you ever what year like two years ago two orbits ago and Simba mattress go and touch and offered to send us a new mattress and just want to this video so I gave them a little look up online because I hadn't heard of them before and they have really really good reviews online so I was well up for that and the mattress is arriving this morning so we are going to get rid of this old one well it's not loud but we're going to try out this new one which is a completely different type of mattress the one we already have so I'm excited to give it a go it should be arriving soon and I really hope we can get it into our flat because it was quite a struggle to get the last mattress up into our little flat something I was really interested to try out is the memory foam aspect of the new mattress this old on we have is just like a standard mattress and it's good but it does take me a while to get to sleep I'm quite like switched on at night I'm a night owl so anything that helped me get sleep faster I am very proud so I'm hoping that the new kind of memory foam mattress will be a lot more comfy it's arrived look genius didn't even realize it was going to come in a box this was so easy to get up to our flap because our old mattress we had to like get it round cornered and it was really hard so in fact this comes in a box oh my god I just realized on matching I'm matching the Cimber box rich to help the guy bring it upstairs and now we can open the box and see what's inside I don't understand how a mattress is in a box I'm intrigued to see how this works I can't believe I'm matching I promise that was not planned I didn't know it's going to be this cut I think the first thing I'm going to do is strip our bedding and take off our current mattress as it's all clear and then we can unpack thing you want and put it on the bed I forgot to tell you the reason we're stripping the bed because I got some really nice new like West Elm bedding I want to put on the new mattress it's all linen and my mom has always raised about like linen bed sheets so I'm really excited to put those on although we haven't ironed them so they're like really crinkly but I think they'll kind of smooth out the more we wash them and use them I think we're going to give this like a base a bit of a Hoover whilst we have the matches up because how often do you do this and rich is finding the loads of dust are disgusting Oh guys clean under your mattresses that is gusting meanwhile you decide take the whole base of our bed move it aside one ah oh my god that's gross okay it's time to roll this out onto the basis of it comes it's my little custom look guys it's like vacuumpack so we actually have to leave this map three to five hours must have been so packed up it needs to like air and breathe out a bit and like really kind of get you set up venal packed up so we can't put the bedding on yet and wears you out this afternoon when I come back I don't know if we're allowed to test out they're just going to do a quick one whew this could be lifechanging guys I might become a morning person you know quite scary getting a new mattress I'm pretty sure this one you get a hundred night free trial so if you don't like it you could send it back and that's like a good enough time to test it as well I feel like you need a good like couple of weeks to see if you like a mattress okay I really need to go out so this is a really bad idea guys this is my new baby it's the Chloe Miley and I love it let me know if you want me to talk about it properly in a video I never know I'm not really a luxury handbag youtube reviewer but I love it I'm just packing up my bag because I'm gonna head into town I'm actually meeting Anna today which is a nice surprise I don't usually see her in London on the weekends but her and her friends are coming up to London and I'm going to go meet them for lunch and I think it's gonna be really nice I'm not going to vlog that much because they're not all like used to being on camera and stuff and but I don't know where we're planning on going for lunch I haven't had any breakfast I think I need to get something on the way I'll bring you guys with me for the rest of the day from wearing my new Nike trainers today here they are they're my Instagram with some pink socks from and other stories or actually I think either from H&M gap jeans and a tshirt from Urban Outfitters which has swimming on the back just got to town it's such a lovely sunny day today and I am desperately seeking a connoisseur color on the hunt can we go get one so that I'm like not Moody and hangry in front of our friends apple and raspberry muffin from workshop coffee which is like my favorite new thing I'm obsessively it's like like contrivance cookies and I got orange and not chocolate one and now I'm going to head back go and find rich rich has kindly picked me up from the station and we have come back to my parents house they need to pick up some of my toast they're actually looking after my sister's kids so we're going to pop over there afterwards because I really want to cuddle with my nephews just going to quickly open up my post sure you guys forgetting the interesting oh I'm actually really excited about it this is the prior new foundation from Mac and I look like a massive fan of Mac foundations that then you one sound bright our mystery is called the next to nothing faith color so it's meant to be love a really lightweight foundation comes in packaging like this which is like their other foundation and yes if you really lightweight I'm going to try and burn now let's see tyranny is best applied with a sponge oh it was really nice and light and glowy it's actually really really lightweight I'd be a really nice summer foundation I can't wait to try that when I get home you're going to wear that tomorrow is like a Sunday foundation I'm pretty sure the last box of stuff it's my recent skin consultation which I'm going to do a blog post on I went to see dr. Stephanie Williams and she analyzed my skin and then gave you a new skincare routine so I'll do proper blood pressure I talked about it but in here is some gel eye makeup remover show me to even like dry costume all rounds is really bad your eye area although I find things like this just so like messy so I tried oh no and the lowest assay and failure XL fifty plus which I have I think this is a different formula I think she said this one's more hydrating than the one I have the lavash chose a reader Moxxi ten anti wrinkle firming concentrate intensive off this is that one that talked about having to you know I'm going my 30s so lost when they read irmak are so this is the retinol cream the skin suit circles redness neutralizer which told me that my skin is actually red the åland skin tone it hides the redness the machine picked up the redness that the human eye can't pick it up so I thought that was really interesting you know some other products as well that I need to get separately that the Piazza CAFTA as I said I'll do a blog post looking all about like it was so interesting we've been drawing on trying to figure out what the day we went to a colles there was a kid and now we've just made a lastminute plan to see Gemma and Ben and we're going to go for dinner and have some Italian actually really excite has some really weird like days I mean something identifies whether the matter like is going help me I know but so I just feel really like something a half an hour till dinner so rich is making we go for a walk in Kenwood that's where you want to be apparently Sun setting it's actually not that warmer it's pretty cold this in here this little garden in here is where we scattered my grandpa's ashes pretty sure we're not allowed but it was a favorite little garden maybe I should put some vlogs I don't forget again shovel no one tell anyone okay Wow look at the sky what Rio and I shall call okay you're breaking my hand I've zoomed into you guys can see this amazing view of London wow this is Kenwood House someone actually lived in that once upon a time you haven't eat so a pasta just in the shop getting some snacks is going to go back to German Benz I have got jaffa cake it's powdered aluminum I like for our Roche Gemma is here pregnant and normally only eat salads that's really fun that she wants a chocolate no again it's nice I'm really enjoying Gemma wanting to eat all the crap but if she never ever ever eats chocolate and it's really fun where else can we get invincibility I've got in for my tracksuit bottoms and borrowing on a friend cities because we are the friendship groups that need to be in can't be closed to socialize apparently I've injured my arms so Ben is making me roll with this ball thing I very know I'm doing but I thought I'd entertain myself by reading Gemma's like baby magazines but I just noticed it like all the baby the photo shop I'm pretty sure like that baby's eye is photoshopped hmm not sure about that one this one is definitely photoshopped I just think that's not cool but I'm going to read baby London this one looks good we're just heading home and we just remembered the worst thing we haven't made the bed as you guys saw earlier we will end the mattress breathe so when we get back now it's like quarter past now probably going to get back the light called 12 and we haven't made the bed ah I so annoying this is the bedding I got from West Elm nice linen is a bit crinkly by since it will get softer I love the pink blush color use the pillowcases and I think you've seen enough of me making the bed for one day I'm going to stop vlogging now and I think I'll vlog again tomorrow I didn't really want a vlog or weekend I feel like I haven't done enough interesting stuff today for it to be like a vlog on its own so I think I'll carry on vlogging tomorrow so I'll see you them good morning everyone it's Sunday morning woo is sunny out there I just woken up I put my new video live it's one I did with my sister where we looked inside her hospital bag lots of nice comments so far thank you for that if you haven't seen it I'll link it of course which I think went out to the gym early this morning's I've just given him a call saying I am craving baked beans and mushrooms on toast I've just woken up and I really fancy that so I bought them to get some from the shop I've obviously just washed my hair on my skincare and stuff I need to straighten my hair which means I have nice clean hair today I'm looking forward to that rich bought me these flowers yesterday and they're so pretty and it makes it like Dragon tulips or something it's just home and you've got the mushrooms going no this mug is neediness number no to yourself and baked beans in the microwave and his coffee contraption thing and see mmm this looks delicious thank you do my makeup and I'm going to try out the Mac foundation I told you guys about yesterday the next to nothing so let you know why I think go they really like the foundation I did have to put two layers on it's very very light but it's like the perfect Sunday foundation I'm used to just wearing like a medium coverage so I did put two layers on but I think is really nice and I wouldn't necessarily go to max foundation so I would definitely recommend trying out right plan today is actually we're doing some like non vlog haul stuff but then I think later I will flop again because I think I'm seeing Gemma and Deb's after lunch I'm wearing my whistles jumper Gucci bag gap jeans and like shoes rich fun to watch optional so I've melt with Gemma and Deb and we come out for tea and some cake I put a funny song you can't go with your pajamas general cinnamon one resounding down oh my god some tea I'm home now and I spent a really nice afternoon with Deb's and Gemma and then Gemma came back here and I just haven't really flogged much because I think I need to stop vlogging on weekends and try do more weekday vlogs because I just want to chill and chat to my friends and not be on camera the whole time so I'm sorry if today hasn't been much of logging and it was so nice to catch up with my friends and have like we have like deep chats the only friends we're all very like adulting at the moment that we have a very like intense deep chats and I love it me and Richard meant to be doing fajitas to dinner which is now saying he doesn't run for heaters so not sure what the plan is but we're gonna it's like o'clock now so we're going to chill out and we got into my chat exposes we're going to watch some TV kind of get ready for a busy week if you guys didn't see my last video I filmed a video of my sister about what's in her hospital bag even if you're not having a baby for not pregnant loads people said they just enjoyed seeing me and my sister talk so go check out that video if you have it yet I'm also going to link my three ways to style a leather skirt video again even if you're not

entertaining so maybe have a watch you might enjoy it I'll see you guys in my next video which is going to be on Sunday pretty sure it's going to be a Q&A I'm planning on filming that tomorrow so I

"yes_THIS IS CRAZY.txt"	"good morning Oh oops good morning how's it going everybody I'm looking today yeah now me and a me and Lucy are going to the rugby sevens later which should be really fun I've never been before but I've heard it's really really good so we're going there yeah I'm about to go to the gym I've just woke up idea yes I haven't been to the gym in five days now which some people that doesn't sound like a long time but when you're like in the routine of it when you don't go five days it's like wow I feel like having one about three weeks so I'm gonna go to the gym I also got back from can I went to can Film Festival Linstrom actually which was like the coolest thing up those the coolest things I've ever done I went to go to amfAR which is this amazing amazing event which is basically raising money to help fight AIDS and find the cure for aids babies you have this massive auction there so they fill the room with loads of like billionaires I'm not billionaires and then basically the idea is that they walk some things off so they have 20 different things and they auction them so a piece of art they'll go they'll tell you about Jonah shut up yeah they're like so we'll start the bidding at 1 million dollars million euros not dollars and then that's the process and then all these people in the room are like ah 1. million 2 million 3 and it's like mental amounts of money being like thrown about but it's all for really a cause which is obviously fine auntie of AIDS I met so many cool people so Leonardo DiCaprio is there didn't meet him walk past him twice I was like Karlie Kloss like what she stood next to me and she was like we like Pantera and the person who introduced me ah ah he's a youtuber like big youtuber in the UK but and then I've got a video of it I might add it and I might knock that might be a bit weird and in the video she was like ah ha ha you're more popular than me and I was like oh thanks what do I say to the happy I met loads of really cool people as well and just head of your time but I got that from can after that and I was tired so I slept like 10 hours and I feel good and I went to the gym that was a really long intro I'm really sorry I also forgot to say hello hi I also forgot to say I finally finally got a new camera like finally I felt bad because the camera I had I'd literally had for so long and it was so battered screamers broke the lens cap was down it's dusty the sound was funny but hey you know what this gives this gives me character when I vlog but then that they bought out a new camera and I was like you know I probably should invest in a new vlog camera first of all this feels weird rocking on the street haven't blogged on the street and while hello probably shouldn't do that again would you guys think about this so I'm going to LA / Vegas like a month in a few weeks I'm going to LA for ten days for work now you going to Vegas for a week and then I'm going back to LA for VidCon but I think you might go to LA for the ten days I might daily vlog there for the ten days on there oh wait not eight or nine days whatever it is what do you think about that vlogging for the whole time I'm in LA I'm just not really normal Marcus good luck to be fun then and today what do you think I do that but yes or no in the comments that was such a good workout nice to get back in the gym I did well it's my back and my biceps and my shoulders if if you're interested at all anyway now I am about jumping shower and then head to the rugby look who's here I'm just I'm just zooming out waiting for it to right so I was in the shower while Lucy to come and then I was drying my hair and when I've got the music playing hair dries going I can't hear when the doorbell rings so check my phone and Lucy's like freaking out because she thought I fell over in the shower and I died of something yeah I hadn't I was fine yeah we were waiting for the car look what I've got so after the gym I went to this place

of was like oh yeah I'm going to rugby but it's the HSBC London sevens which I don't know much about but it's like it's like a it's like a twist on rug because it's sevenaside so usually rugby's like more than seven rugby Tiffany right rugby's usually 50 inside so this is like seven aside and it's like mini Taunton and stuff and everyone goes and has a good time and it's just really fun so we're going to that but there is a new thing in this stadium called the Samsung slider which is basically the best seats in the house and what it is this little like tube of seats that are along the side of

total player flipping game tomorrow I did order some food ages ago they are way too small and I sent them back ages ago I just forgot to get other ones so I'm quickly I should probably grab my football boots before the game tomorrow so quick guns got put boots hanging in head home and chill the woman has found one pair left of these there's the limited edition ones size ten and a half they have no laces they're really cool so I think I might get them right back home I just went planet organic quick to grab some food I say food it's more like snacks and below this I need it so I got three packs of these these are the loops protein person literally the best thing in the world they're so tasty I promise you but obviously they're healthy but everyone that comes around has and they're like okay they're actually amazing pop of these which just have one now a clip protein bar they're dead decent as well so yeah I've got them for tomorrow actually for the football got some sushi which we might the eat now I'm starving honey and lunch which you guys know I eat a lot of food and today it might sound like a lot already have my gym shake this morning like a proper like gym shade of oats and everything maybe a back from the gym had a pit had another protein shake and then I had an acai bowl don't you thought and then I had a cookie thing like a health cookie at the rugby which I took with me and that's all I've had and it's now five o'clock now for me I would have had like a whole massive lunch while in as well and then more snacks so I'm going to eat that sushi before dinner later but yeah the reason I got this it's good tonight I'm just gonna have a chilled shirt I'm just gonna have a chilled film night you know and I feel like I have I'm just chill for long I've been very busy recently which is great I'm just gonna chill just hang out watch films I'm just chillin on the left top so that's a music playlist and stuff over to all of you I just posted a video on Instagram which I've been doing a little bit more recently because when I can I went with Instagram so like Instagram invited me and took me there which is like unbelievably cool with them and yeah they were talking about like posting more videos and some that so I've been doing a couple more videos on Instagram what do you guys think of that like I really like the idea of doing it but at the same time it's like our bad dog what a mess my femur up and all that stuff but I don't really have a theme so yeah I just wanted to get your thoughts on posting Instagram videos because I think it's a thing that's gonna grow and more people do it so not like snapchat how obviously you guys who follow me on snapchat know I post like a lot on snapchat so I don't think you'll get to that I don't want my small on sale and do it but just every now and again maybe like a video a day or like every now and again just chat and basically and Sam what's up and showing like a minute of doing that day as then what are your thoughts that's what I asked you that's how excited well I haven't started my movie movie yet it's seven o'clock and I haven't started it because I'm just too interested in music right now I'm also not sure what I'm gonna watch I think I might watch Captain America's because new ones out in the cinema it's many amazing I've never seen anybody Captain America's which is priced so usually love superhero films so might do that oh yes I've got my you know cuz I have my movie night I was I don't want to cook oh wait actually this is the type you guys probably have seen already but I'm doing Celebrity MasterChef mental I mean I say I'm doing I've already done it it's already filmed but it's coming out sometime soon but yeah chorim i tell you i'm just talking about food and I was like oh that's why it says ah didn't want to cook tonight because of my like chill night didn't cook Saturday night vibe so yeah I went for my favorite takeaway which is wrong kitchen look how good this is so basically jerk chicken with pineapple watermelon it is incredible here you got sweet potato wedges with avocado avocado and coconut on top and then with the chicken comes a little portion of rice which pan out um Graham sometimes have sometimes don't it is the bomb and I'm gonna start with Captain America right now that's what I'm gonna watch so here we go gonna stop a movie night probably wait to be judged for a while right guys I am now in bed I have had such chilled night also though she always laughs about my little pony tail now the reason I do this it's because going to sleep with long fringe white hairs long like really don't like it's a little boy as you can see it all comes literally in my mouth I can get the hair in the mouth so having hair like trying to sleep with hair like this in my face does my head in and it doesn't just stay there like that in the night so hey man tie it up keeps how your face right anyway I really hope you have enjoyed today's vlog if you have give it a thumbs up umm yeah like I said I'm doing I'm starting to do a bit more wrong in like every now and again so hope you guys like that and yeah I'll see you tomorrow with another more Marcus video all right good night"	2976
"yes_UN VLOG PRETTY PARIS  AD  Lily Pebbles Vlog.txt"	"yeah pleasure justly on party I was that probably not great I am here in Paris I've come on a trip with bourgeois and it's nice to be back been a little while since I've been to Paris actually I'm here with Freddie Alec Kate and another Alex as well we had a really nice journey up on the Eurostar we like chatted the hallway and I head to the video it was very productive and I'm now in our beautiful hotel room the hotel is called hotel Bashar mall and it's so nice we haven't really had a chance to look around much but we just checked in and my room is beautiful it's like a lovely mix between modern and classic very pretty and very happy to be here very excited to sleep in this bed so we're here to learn about bourgeois new releases they've got loads of new releases coming throughout the next year I think we're going to be learning about four of them on this trip and the main one is a foundation I'm going to be talking to you more about the launches and stuff tomorrow but I just wanted to say hi and check in we've got about an hour I think in our rooms and then we're going to go out for dinner just the UK Lots it's going to be pretty casual this is actually a global events as vloggers from all around the world going to be at this event tomorrow which is really cool because I get to meet other beauty bloggers but tonight just us so we're going to keep it quite lowkey go somewhere to dinner I'm not sure where but I'm building up an appetite so that we know the weather's not looking great but it will still be lovely it's still Paris this is a little bed area of the room there's like a giant mirror here which is always very much appreciated and then look at this bathroom how cool is this tiling I absolutely love it and it kind of goes round the back and it all mirrored cupboards and there's a little toilet in there as well such a nice room I'm going to head down to reception to meet everyone else we're going for dinner at restaurant called lecompt word is pretty shot which I don't think I've been to although I looked it online and kind of recognised it so I might have been meant to be really nice apparently they changed the menu like every time you go so I'm going to head downstairs and meet everyone else dinner was delicious I'm heading to bed I'll see you guys tomorrow I woke up bright and early this morning because I wanted to take some photos in my hotel room I didn't really think about the fact that it's still dark here at court Class eight it's pitch black outside so that plan didn't really work I'm going to get on and do my makeup for the day because we're going to meet downstairs breakfast in about half an hour so one of the products that I'm here to learn about is actually a foundation and I'm sure you guys know the Bourjois healthy mix foundation it's been around forever definitely one of my favorites because it's very like gooey and light and easy to wear I've always really liked it but they've actually we formulated it so this is the new one the packaging is slightly different it's still called the Bourjois healthy mix foundation and we're going to put it on now for you on camera so you can see I'm actually learning about it today I found out a little bit about it already but today we're like going around Paris and we have a little have a little like guy book and we're basically going around Paris to learn about all these different launches I think this foundation is the one that we're ending on it's not that difference the original formula this one's like packed full of vitamins and it gives you that jewy fresh light skin it's very radiant boosting so you really get that glow for me it's like the perfect weekend foundation but if you like a light to medium coverage then it's like an everyday foundation as well says I make that it's 16hour wearing so I could probably test out today if I put it on now yeah I reckon I'll be wearing this for 16 hours today so I'm going to test out the 16 hour where I'd always apply it for you now on camera and you can see because I wore this yesterday so the first part of my vlog I was already wearing this foundation let's put some one now I'm just going to pump it onto my hand and then apply it straight on the skin I also love the smell of his foundation the same smell as the old formula it's very like pretty fresh so when I applied it yesterday I did a really thin layer and then I went on with the second one so it builds really nicely which I always like that in foundation because some days you want a bit more coverage than others I'm usually really damp sponge just to add to the doing and can you see how fast it blends into the skin I like that so that's pretty much blended in but what I'll probably do is add a little bit more in places where I want a bit more coverage so that whatever I say it's kind of like a light coverage and if you want to build it up to medium sometimes I just take another pump and just add a bit to the center of my face also something I noticed which is a bit of a weird observation is that it's got a really nice pump you know some foundations when you pump the product it just gives you like one massive square product you can't really control it this was really easy to control which I really like in the foundation I didn't realize I did until I kind of noticed that with this one by the way guys I am getting so good at being a morning person like it was one of my new visions and I'm much better at waking up in the morning now there you go that is that foundation looks like so I like when a brand like tweaks the formula they haven't completely changed it's not going to upset old customers that love this foundation it's just a slight tweak to make it a little bit better I think it's great right I'm going to get on doing the rest of my makeup I think Kate coming to my room because she's going to help me take some photos and then I'm going to eat lots of pastries because that's what you're doing you're in front we're about to head off I just came up to get my coat and I thought I show you this little top I got it from Topshop it's stripy and I had French on it I'm so French today and honestly I can't remember what this says I googled it in the shop for me feel it wasn't weird oh I can't remember but it's not actually that clear anyway so I'm hoping it's not anything weird my little stripy top jeans and combos because we have lots of walking to do today so I have to be comfy I'm also

up my makeup curled my hair and got dressed and I'm wearing the same outfit I always wear I like to wear things more than once I like to really wear clothes but I do feel like I've worn this one too many times this is the top from DVF I actually had a voucher for farfetched which is why I bought it I wouldn't normally spend that much on the top this nexuses farm at Brown called by Alana it was a gift from Clinique for my birthday this blazer from Topshop Steve seems actually new because they're the Jamie jeans that they've got they've got little tassels here can you see film that really badly and my Topshop boots I know I've worn this outfit too many times I'm sick of it you guys must be sick of it I haven't go any evening clothes I just don't know what to wear I'm actually gonna film a video with my friend Debs she is great she's pretty much like a stylist even though she doesn't do that as a fulltime job at the moment I think we're going to analyse my wardrobe figure out some key pieces that I need and then go out shop buy some stuff and I'm hopefully going to film the whole thing although I feel like a lot of things can we go on a sauce and obviously have to work with us to arrive so maybe I'll get her to pick a few things for me on a sauce beforehand when they arrive we'll film the video something like that I think I'll be really cool because I need some evening clothes got these lights terribly unflattering I need an evening coat evening clothes I don't know I have like really smart dresses for like award ceremonies but I really hate wearing dresses for I have jeans

"yes_Very Haul & The X Factor Vlog  Freddy My Love ad.txt"	"hi everyone welcome back today I'm so excited because very dr. dot uk' are taking me to the xfactor live shows now I have been watching it every single week this year so I know all of the acts and I cannot wait to see them perform in real life and very have also been kind enough to provide me with my outfit for tonight so I thought I would just talk you through my outfit and then I can also take you with me when I go to studio later on so my first option was this gorgeous dress and I decided not to wear this in the end because the coats that I liked was black and I wasn't sure how I felt about mixing navy blue and black but this is the dress and it's this really lovely like knitted wool navy blue dress with this really pretty white scalloped edge collar and it's also got the white cuffs as well it's really nice and tight fitting it's long sleeves it's wool it's really warm it's just like the perfect winter dress and I will definitely be wearing this on another occasion but unfortunately not tonight my whole outfit can be purchased on vary code at UK and I will leave the links to everything down below in the description box very also offers a free Next Day Delivery Service through collect Plus which is amazing because that's probably the one downfall with online shopping is either paying for delivery or choosing the free option but having to wait like five to seven working days that's the worst so the outfit that I've chosen to wear is firstly this blouse which I absolutely love it's so me it's just like a lovely loosefitting chiffon e blouse and it has this beautiful embellished collar with little flowers with little beads and also you might not be able to tell but it's got like a double layer so it's just much nicer than just having like it's going straight down I love this because it's really girly but still really cool at the same time and then I've decided to pair the blouse with this skirt which is a lovely black denim highwaisted skirt with the buttons going down the front which is very very ontrend right now very literally has a massive variety of clothes to suit everyone it's basically like an online Negus there is so much and everything's really on trend and qhorin and like I said just variety for all different styles and I'm going to wear this skirt right up on my waist so that this top layer of the top will kind of come over it and have my favorite part of the outfit which is the coat it's actually a cape but it's just my favorite thing ever it's amazing it's this black like faux Pony skin okay the light is making it really hard to show it on camera but you will see it in the vlog it's just this beautiful black like faux Pony skin cape with a satin lining and it's just so so super stylish and sleek you can literally put this over anything it would just make it look fantastic it's so sophisticated I'm on a stage of itching to get this on I love it so much it just makes me feel like a movie star is amazing and finally the shoes I'm gonna be wearing today are these beautiful black suede chelsea boots from Miss kg and they are so lovely they're slightly pointed but not too pointed I really don't like pointy boots and a little like Cuban heel and it's the perfect heel height to me because I do like to be a bit lifted and not wear like fully flat boots and these like the perfect heel height they're probably about like one to two inches so enough to give you a bit of a lift but not full on wearing heels I absolutely love these these are perfect for winter I'm not going to take them off and obviously today they're going to look amazing with my outfit so I will be getting dressed and leaving quite soon my hair and makeup is done I've just gone for a half up half down style and curled it loosely and just done my kind of everyday makeup routine and the lipstick I'm wearing today is honey love from Mac but before I go I will put on a spritz of perfume of course and the one I'm going to use is Miss Dior which is one of my favorite perfumes you can purchase this from very also as well as a ton of other fragrances so that's everything I've got to show you that's my whole outfit that I'm gonna be wearing tonight my taxis coming in about an hour's time so I will see you and I'm there so I'm just in the car on my way to X Factor my I cannot wait I'm so excited to see fourth power thenwife ups it I said again their fourth impact it's not fourth power can't wait see how and Louisa and Reggie in Bali Bali didn't we pronounce it that's so good it's such good year this year so cut way back stage xfactor makeup room and they're just rehearsing at the moment so and we're just getting hyped up for the live shows I'm so excited so I'm just in the X Factor dressing which is like clothes and shoot heaven there is just a sparkle everywhere and therefore all the different contestants so we've got fourth impact here which is quite empty actually because I think that on at the moment or there abouts going once I probably already dressed you don't like a dimple everyone loves dimples I know I have them so they've got them another their faults very beautiful charcoal has really big gun please so this is Gemma and I stylist on X Factor probably the best job of the whole show so I'm really blessed have this job I love doing this show but I think that we've got great contestants I think we have a lot of fun I can imagine having your favorite contestants to style this year so far not other it undeniably Shawn I know yes me as a stylist that's a stylists dream so are you actually seeing it on the show yes I've been before okay I would say that everybody and then I should get back Sam you see exactly so what briefly like the process you got to go out and buy all these pieces no I know I mean we're really lucky and obviously I work with a team of stylists so great an amazing team we've worked really closely together I mean it is about pulling knowing who to contact knowing where to go and it's calling in a lot of favors all the time so we've only customizable you know chop things up and stop in Monica's about something like that so hopefully I've just created that's a creation we created it I've just seen your show you the bond feels you looks incredible I'm so jealous do you have one of your best style tips for winter for my viewers I think best style tip for winter is to um I always think investing breakers I'm a girl all about here and so I always say one great pair of heels because actually they're much comfier and so if you're going to make a big investment do it in the heels and then as a kind of a compact that we've got something in your wardrobe I'm a massive fan of layering I think it's a great way to dress I think it creates really good shapes and it's different I like everything different so I was like winter by great shoes and having the wrong pony I almost either feel no I should know I like well I mean I'm so cool and I've been uncomfortable I get to bother me thank you so much okay thank you for coming thank you so much so it just in the car home it's like I said it was so good I couldn't film inside the studio because you're like not allowed I didn't expect to get so into it literally I was jumping and screaming and laughing it was so fun the favorite were Louise it was really good this week pushy and every week which was very good this week Reggie and Bowie were like honesty we were on our feet just going crazy throughout looks the almanac group sure oh yeah we hate Nick Grimshaw now because he insulted Max's max stone song which was so good I'm going to download it it was over the rainbow I'm a wonderful world in the room honestly it was so so good I'm Nick it's so mean thing it was a good I had a really good night and we know who are voting for in a comment"	1617

"yes_VLOG  Visiting Copenhagen On A Budget + Bike Fails"	"and if I wore like a white born spoiler sue I would look like someone who's gonna fix your electrical probably hello so I am back I'm looking I have my camera it is six yay I'm so happy I'm so happy I'm also in Copenhagen oh my god recovering and so exciting I'm actually letting this hopper on a video today which is very exciting I think this is my first video collab so yeah you know it really it means a lot policy means a lot and I'm in Copenhagen as well and you know I love traveling so hope I have actually challenged us to do Copenhagen on a budget because they've done a report and Copenhagen is the third most expensive place to you know Holiday Inn and I've actually been here this is my third time so the first time I stayed with a friend so it kind of you know we went to some reasonable places second time we were hauling who as a brand so you know we ate like three starters and main in the desert it's time around we're going to do lots of you know three things we're in an air B&B our Airbnb is absolutely beautiful let me show you oh my god like it is gold look at this chair so yeah really really nice I'll show you the rest later but it's just really really nicely done you know obviously very sandy I think I'm going to buy like flax tea bit so that's one of our meals covered yeah it's the combination of like strategic strategically filling lunches and maybe a small dinner or like the other way around so you know hey we can do it I'm excited to see another side of Copenhagen you know when you go somewhere three times you're kind of bit more chilled and you're not rushing around as much but also I'm here with someone else let me show you oh oh oh oh they come through is that what we come through as you guys come through we're showing here in my standard bed Shannon the house and we were bonding over all black girl problems but actually Holston as you see and she has important Easter eyes that I'm like there's only so much moisturizer I can give you right couple and what you scroll by the Kiera always bring a fact as moisturizer we have this lens Ryanair so a little bit tricky but yet this is a bedroom we've got it's really really nice like really really nicely done you can tell a guy lives here because there's no floor mats mirror there's no been in the bathroom there are just very few mirrors there is some seasoning so I'm excited to convert to every much Atkins evening but you've got Mexican seasoning so we can make a bit of Mexican I've packed hand luggage somehow I've got like five outfits three bags three pairs of shoes I am a master of hand luggage but I never really do it I challenge myself so that should be a really really exciting trip so we're going to head out now and explore Copenhagen we're going to try the open savages and read about pronouncing things there being a difference so I can't direct objects only for people I supported people watch I feel like community that free due to the tree like I like this interesting boy to suit and if I will like a white all in foiler I would look like someone who's it if it's your electric love it we thought we'd go for like this traditional open sandwich and then we've got districting we like I just as opposed to doing and yet the bigger picture of the added bonus little bit green I'm not I'm not oh no you can sort of oh don't you take my dipping in this is basically where you get the best cinnamon roll in the world I've been dreaming about these four year yeah so I change ok this is one of a colorful shops in Copenhagen we actually move the same because we are bloggers basically like my room in shop format look at these color and then loads of the book the sea floor type as well so yeah we're in good hands we're super cannon which is a really cool part I think that it feels it's a sort of represent all of the different communities living in the area and what I remember I think some abroad like the view will be really cool ok so this is really this is another part of the park but I actually missed out on last time and review like everywhere I think I've eaten bloggers having a little shoot okay we're trying to get in connect so one bit confused we thought we'd gone in the wrong way but that was the entrance okay so we all obviously very unfamiliar with nesco and we're going to go buy some food for breakfast tomorrow to the other B&B yeah I'm gonna make sure how much your evening has such a long day been up since 5:00 5:00 a.m. oh yeah yeah so yeah we've got signal rolls left over and I want the dinner with the leftover chicken wings so that's a bit random but who cares where Copenhagen I'm going to sign up for today and I'll see you in the morning hello so it is Wednesday and we're going to attempt to hire a bike and ride the bike in Copenhagen but I think you know the card will be forgiving I'm going to hire these donkey bikes let me show you I know these are not don't you like these are different maybe these might be the easier let's see how do we do this English so I cycle did not go to plan I think the bikes are just very confusing and by the time we'd signed up like minutes to sign up and then I accidentally like move the seat so it was like higher than my head and then I got a bike and I couldn't actually move off like it was just really stiff and I don't understand I don't know something wrong the bike and now we're just running a little bit late from Paul it's really annoying I'm lacking the apartment that had to run a getting phone charger because I just was carrying a bit crazy and I just needed a needed contact the world outside we put on to another tour also got a cut on my leg I think I might kicked a bike accident was trying to pedal and maybe caught a leg on the right so but yeah I just really wanted to cycle I've been doing lots of practice so bit gutted but maybe we'll try bit later on so basically we're going to do a lot of walking today but a walk to the walking tour walk around probably walk back because okay I don't know where the buses go so I'm selecting Armin and that's being left nav and then I guess number two biking country in the world writer for Honda that means that here and there in Copenhagen we have a lot more bikes than we have car actually you know as people in Copenhagen they have to make one for the waste of time and one for the summertime or you know when the first one gets stolen your local speed is true the reason why the houses are painted different colors is because the sailors use River where they live similar to parado Island in medicine it's just another day today we've really lucked out with the weather tomorrow it's mr. rain and then for the following like six days on seismic terrain applause so yeah things are just so much better when it's sunny we finished our tour basically learn about Denmark there's lots of palaces there are a lot of fires back in the day and there's a lot of likes so I think it's a really good way to just get your bearing and get to know Missy that was a very good choice we're going to going to have for lunch so if we have taken street food I think only get Korean food is going to have flavor Susan get the ribbon back this goes back really tell me anything right Andy we just finished filling that with a deep and esteemed as of that it's boiling and we're going to head to hey the horse shop is basically gold like look at everything okay is a really cool wet Danish design store and there's a sale just went a bit crazy intuition department they have got all of these cushion covers for I think like 80% off and I hope they're going to fit in my suitcase I'm willing to wear the cushions if I have to you know Ryanair if you're going to be technique Osasuna we're at blows kazoo cutter and it's very fancy very pretty looking taco you know fare quite tasty but more pipe using the same the tacos were nice weren't they but quite claiming I don't know it's reasonable it's kind of like maybe Copenhagen reasonable we just went to places where you could just grab food not necessary a drink we're going to sit in the famous graveyard for a bit it's where people like maybe have Christie Mae Larssen let be buried famous people and yeah we've done about 30,000 stairs so this is what happens when you don't figure out how to hire a bike you basically look 10 miles I'm hoping hoping I've got some nice toned legs her people people treat this paint in the park aha there we go and Christian Anderson just had a little sit down and our dumplings and get a head back to the apartment and I need to get on with some work so yes can't wait to chill and rest my tired feet hello it is Thursday we are going down six flights of stairs every single day and we are back to that perfect depth know the basic PD although within the attempt of cycling again but I tried a dog bite for these other bite see if they work fingers crossed because what a lot of grounds we want to cover today come up with a crazy itinerary of I'm currently crazy you know planner a little bit like monitor from friends and yeah I'm going to see what we had done we had another bike fail for some reason just a little bit confusing and I can't tell whether you can hire for a day you know and forest by cute obviously pay for the day but you can drop it off pick it up drop it off I don't know if you can do that here and then it says it'll charge you 300 euros if I get stolen and there's no talking points I'm just I'm confused I'm confused Copenhagen like what are you doing to be I love the cycle for you will give us trouble to another doctor you boy which is kind of in the direction mobile need to go and hopefully we'll have a little more like so now it's time to take two obviously what the episode and cycle at the same time but I'll let you know how I get on I have successfully cycling across Spain or in Friedreich's burg wasn't meant to come here but oh well I don't know where shard is I think she's having a bit of trouble with the bike quite heavy and just a bit unpredictable I can either electronic bike and what I heard a crash and I hope that wasn't her I actually had a bit of a near miss on the way so this car I was cycling and finally managed to you know move off on the bike and then this car just pulled out in front of me and I freaked out and locking it stops but then I can't move off and then I'm just like stuck in with the road and then the Spanish girl was like are you okay and then I just started crying in Spanish girl she was like hugging me and she was holding three plugs it was really really nice it's just like you know those bikes are really heavy even she knows that they're heavy because I just worry that I look like a car cycle and you know I've been practicing and I know I can do it it's just really frustrating when the bike is electronic and you don't realize it's electronic and yes it's a bit of drama so I ended up walking a good bike for a bit trying to find the docking point got even more lost and then ended up cycling to the to the docking point because it was just quicker so now we want to catch this really nice to lunch we're so busy like oh so busy we've missed the lunch so what like the breakfast so we're going to go to a different place which is like Texan barbecue and I feel like I've earned it so really excited about that these are somewhere that's been recommended it's meant to be Texan barbecues or we go it's Nashville so I have only that compared with but I'm happy how it is so we are now in Christian province which is little Amsterdam apparently and it's also very similar like the houses with justin trudeau calls the apartment which are the design video they've collected all episodic really reflected not only standing by claiming like they're having these colorful and send the whip around and they're going to be opening an actual patterns that you can rent like an air B&B and it's going to be done out in the same style so that something to you know say before just finished in the Design Museum and I found the key street in the world not long got about cuz of hours until we asked a to the airport I'm going in search more cinnamon rolls and I'm going to try it and sit them in my hand luggage I am back at the edgy and be freshened up a little bit and then I had looks a bit crazy but yeah that was it Copenhagen on a budget so I think we have a budget of 75 pounds per day including like the Airbnb food I'm going to put all the details in my blog post which should be very live very soon and I will leave the link in the description box you had to do it in a bit of budget it is a bit tricky because of the exchange rate it's not ideal but I think if you're creative with where you go and what you order like we didn't order any alcohol wouldn't really within order like starters or desserts or anything we just try to get a good substantial main meals that would see us through most of the day and then like chop it up we will go into the supermarket as well walked a lot we just thirty thousand steps yesterday I think I did twenty thousand today even I wasn't meant to it wanted to cycle I think if you're going to psychology but you're a bit nervous you might be better off going to one of the bike shops that you see doc get around town and at least there you can get them to explain you know how to lock the bright properly where to leave it any tips because I feel like the bike I skied have to know all the ins and outs and it's not ideal if you're a tourist I've been very confusing and bicycling bikes just avoid avoid they are heavy they get stuck so electric I don't understand how they work just really wanted to say I wanted to put my skills to good use because I know it's very unlikely that I'm going to be cycling around you know central London I like the fact that there were cycle lanes you know what I did is I thought it was quite nice it's quite calming I saw different parts of the city we're going to head in our hopper transfer to the airport I'd like to thank Poulter for working with me on this video they've got a competition running or hosting our hacks competition where you can win a mill for two at a really nice restaurant in London the lorries to do is upload a picture of your travel hack whatever you may have to do whether it's walking 30,000 steps to avoid paying for public transport or you know maybe you found a really great free activity to do let me know and it really sucks I love obviously love traveling off you love saving money I think my money saving video is one of my most popular and a lot of you another one like that so yes make sure you enter and good luck a great time Copenhagen I've seen even more and it's just such a cool city like I wanted to appear if it's can build a bike it it wasn't going to happen I definitely think I'll be back is my third time there's still more to do and it's just a really chilled place to go to on a city break so yeah it'd be great if you kids like this subscribe it would make my day leave a comment as loss thing that we saw or whether you done anything like this in Copenhagen and yeah thank you for watching and I will see you very soon bye"	3182
"yes_Vlog Babies, Beauty and Back to Being Me"	"we have a smile can we have a smile hi everybody I was going to do a sort of a weekly vlog can you be quiet while mommy films honestly never work with animals or children but we don't really get out much to me and so I just thought it would be a weird video of us being in and me saying I'm going to do some work now and I'm going to cook some lunch now maybe we're boring so I thought what do instead is a bit of a themed video on some of the things I've been doing to get back to normal life I don't know just trying to be a bit more like me again so I've been sorting out my clothes checking out my maternity stuff that's gone to my nextdoor neighbor because she's having a baby and just various things that I've been doing that I've now got a bit more time for because he sleeps and a bit more regularly and I'm not just constantly breastfeeding him he's a lot more talkative than he was before they aren't you oh how am I going to get up from this position Ted ah ah workwise I haven't managed to get into my office yet I'm still pretty much working from my bedroom and from the smoke next door I'm gonna pass a baby kiss daddy and then we can get on with showing my oh my oh nice what do you think nobody wants you to go cuz you're so cute what do you think about that ah definitely smoothly pretty much why spend my day doing it be really cool oh he's not a does he you're not a turbulent be a I've been sorting out all my beauty stuff that I'm testing and making an effort firstly it's a sort of um put on makeup every day hey because it just makes me feel like I've spent some time on myself even as it just takes 2 or 3 minutes but also because I have so many things to test and if I don't put on and I don't put on any makeup then I don't test anything out so I've kind of need to do that so a lot of time I work from my laboratory which is the ensuite a lot of the time I work from bed with my laptop however I've started migrating into here this is a snack hold on this is Mary this is a chair you might recognize this chair from in the background of a couple of recent videos and I basically turned the chair into a table and then the poof thing is my seat which is probably really dreadfully bad for my back but um it's only temporary and then I sort of doing my filming in here I come over there this is my view which is always very lovely especially on a nice summer's day and then camera and loads and loads of these things that I've been testing and I've just got rid of the baby because it quite new me in here because I've been spraying those of different fragrances and dry shampoo and all sorts of stuff and I'm about to do my nails what loads of lip stuff there but I'm going to put that in a video coming up soon so I've got really nice summer colors that I want to show you this box has just arrived this is from sunny hansen sec and it's a new range which is called color therapy it's really really up for my street because i'm quite low maintenance with my nails and i like this being really good condition so what they've done with this range is they've blended the color with argan oil and also a couple of other oils as well it's some sort of a complex of oils to really help to strengthen and repair your nails if they're you know flimsy flaky fragile which mine are at the moment I think it's something to do with some breast feeding maybe maybe the baby's taking all the good stuff from me and leaving me with nothing and why I really like about it is that you don't need a base coat so it's got all the care that you need in the actual formula so no base plate straight in with color and it caring for your nails while you color them basically and there's also a topcoat in the range as well all and there's nail and cuticle oil so all of this very good for me for sort of getting back with it with my nails because I didn't really paint them that much when I was pregnant and I'm looking forward to using some really nice color fades in the summer now there are shades all together and they've been created in partnership with Madeline poule who's their global color ambassador I know there's a massive thing to pink at the moment so I've pulled up some Pink's here so what's this one called oh my magenta that one really into these sort of quite bubblegummy Pink's at the moment I put loads more information in the description box below that these are all available only at Boots and that is from the 12th of April so now basically I cannot find a single thing to wear my leggings which is what basically I live in I have been living in are in the wash and the dress from and all that I've been wearing my denim dress is also in wash because Angelica burger yogathon it and so I feel like I've just got nothing else left where now but then I thought in the spirit of this video I could turn it into a positive thing and I'm going to go through my wardrobes and sort of look out some things that I can actually fit into and then on the lost has loads of summery stuff in suitcases but mr. amar has gone out and I know that there's loads of sort of loose dresses and stuff that actually I'll be really good but I thought that what I would do is sort of get rid of almost looks like pink doesn't it get rid of things that I'm never going to wear again and put them into charity and then find out some things that I haven't worn that would fit me now and sort of shops my stash if you ask me so that's what I'm doing I'm shopping my stash I just found where are they Hey and those coat hangers might be really short on coat hanger set up good but a family buy on 1,000 bucks trousers I think I bought in Palm Springs than either there with Sam from Dixie moon years and years ago and we think they might fit me she liked that I keep losing things going yeah I'm going to get rid of that and then thinking hum but one day I'm going to fit it hmm have to get that try on that one anything like this are beautiful when I hang on to it this is a sheer shirt hush if I try to wear that moment a my beads amasses so it wouldn't do any justice and B it's just sort of logistics of breastfeeding it's just a bit messy sometimes and I don't know really anything so all of these things should stay in wardrobe see I'm probably a little coat again can you see it like a really shaggy coat I'm so used to getting rid of stuff on smooth that shows never going to fit the illusion there's never going to fit me either but our hands loose I'm hanging on through everything they did awake I found loads of stuff that I really want to wear so I can't wait to wear I just can't really wear it at the moment but that's good it's something to look forward to admit you're get these shirts I bought when I was pregnant with a view to wearing when I wasn't about that one I bought a proper leopard print one and I found a couple of really nice shirt dresses but I could probably breastfeed in at a push I remember this one I've worn loads before again I'm I think I'm quite warm today I'm actually about all I have that um that have buttondown frame so that's good isn't it I might have to go on a lot a bit more so I'm addressing I think that it's probably gonna be cold again tomorrow so I was back to my leggings my shirt and my long desktop and stepping up my game makeupwise partly because I don't want mention this value in the week I'm trying to test out leave her hair stuck to my lip cut hair I'm trying to test out loads of new beauty and get back to my usual sort of regime of testing lots of things so I'm trying to write different kind of lipstick everyday hmm I'd say that everywhere the knife suddenly it's made my whole face really pay or have meant well ladies and gentlemen that most interesting thing that's going to happen today probably apart from playing tea parties with Angelica my legs trick I'm going to the temple have shower before Angelica and her daddy get back from the shops I'm working to have Ted and there is a baby bjorn in the shower room aren't we we're going to get in hopefully a reflection of herring up handsome brother isn't showing there's mostly lots of going out and doing stuff in this video and showing how much of a woman of the world I am but we haven't managed to get out have we Angelica no yes I say no what have you got there so I thought what I would tell you because we've got to finish soon oh you're hoping that I thought I'd tell you about something that's sort of been on my mind for the last um week or so since well since I was signed off healthwise yeah after the csection and just because I started a little bit better and I really want to just get moving more and feel a bit fitter and healthier so first of all I'm trying to overhaul our meals a bit although I haven't started that yet and and this book I feature on my website quite a few times I think I've had a few years is recommended by my friend Maya there she's got really nice recipes in come back please I'm going to Colette open the box and then this came to me last week and it's called the fifth bunk books Fitness pregnancy and beyond and it's been specially designed for postpartum fitness soundclick exciting try this hold on let's open the box and I'll see what's inside it says v unbox is unusual and then it combines the physical products the Pilates equipment it will discover in the box and fit guys with a very complete and supportive online pregnancy and postnatal Pilates program so I'm excited to start it and I might try to start this week so I hope you've enjoyed this some getting back to being me blargh all sorts of the things I've been doing to feel a little bit more like an individual adult person nice to do a few things it's very easy to slip into the thing of just wearing leggings of the day which I have been doing and just sort of feeling a bit down in the dumps so these are just ways of making myself feel a little bit more human and in touch with the adult well I hope you enjoyed this and I should see you next time"	2127

"yes_VLOG Family Day"	"morning guys or I guess I should say hey man uh please you're probably wondering if I've uploaded this video to the wrong channel but I haven't I decided I'd give login stay in the live type thing for this channel and send my other ones for change nothing too much is happening state so chill day so weekend dog home so the weekdays are very much busy busy lots of stuff happening but weekends are just full funded conduct family I usually do do a little bit work but at the weekends and I get it Tom to myself which my to get to get ready here in the bedroom which I'm about to do now whereas usually I get ready in the living room on the floor with the liner next to me involved in around town and trying to steal my makeup I don't get to talk you through it really it's just my usual if I don't do many em get ready with me because are you send was driver the same makeup that I've used for years and if nothing is you're interested I always keep my makeup very simple I teamed up with Zoe to collaborate with them on this video and very our grandma I've bought things from for the last I don't know three four years those regularly I pull stuff from them at the bedroom that you see in the background like the actual closes do they and match of detectives and all of that as I'm very I have like Mike's and hard drives and stuff from them like I use them a lot so very kindly let me pick whatever I wanted off their website but I upgraded a few bits in the house that needed replacing either because they were broken or they were just very very old I'm also filming on a new camera right now which are very as well I picked out a few things that would give my work life and my home life a bit of a boost and upgrade so in a way this talk will kind of have a bit of a home within it because you'll get to see the naughty items that I got from very and throughout the blog and I was rambling I'm going to get ready this one's broken up from her nap your hairs looking pretty I am currently eating the most unripe banana ever Delilah has broken art quite a lot earlier than what she normally does from her nap I am going to rush to get dressed and sort my hair out so as much as I want to stay in my snugly jumper I should probably change because the weather has warmed up quite a lot this week and I've just got a few bits together we'll get a head to the park so I've got two LYLAS some hat some song Queen for her and I'm going to take my new Canon 700d with us because I've been filming a little bit with that today already camera it's a lovely sunny day we cook weird grab some food and then hits the park and have a look picnic look at how amazing their cakes look every time I come in there looks so good and I never get one so I think I'm going to get some of the sweet and also sleep grab a salad so I picked up blueberry mascarpone slice how yummy that looks got this salad the mixture of three different ones as that asparagus worm as a coleslaw and as I sweet potato cheese one I also grabbed myself whole earth lemonade note apparently it's the mothers heading home now this Delilah's naptime and also it's very hot it gets warmer today than I expected it's big I feel like I'm abroad so we got home put Delilah down for her nap she woke up after about 20 minutes dogs taking her outside to go play on the grass whilst I do some emails and some edited but before I do that I'm gonna rent myself a coffee or with my brand spanking new coffee machine this is our new coffee machine so we originally had the espresso pixie which I've had for about three or four years now and it was pretty much on its way out I'll link everything in the description letter always do anything you see be it close via these items I'm showing you from very anything we'll be linked in the description and now one good thing about this new coffee machine is that I can actually fit these mugs underneath it with my old machine it was a lot smaller these bigger mugs wouldn't go further and us back I used to have to grab a knife and put the knife under the coffee mug like that so it tilted it just enough so that the coffee would go into the mug so I love that now I can just clip this up put my mug under oh and with my coffee I'm going to have my blueberry mascarpone slice thingy honey I'm just gonna crack on with and reply to emails just you know something that's always gonna kind of help me with my email yeah we've nipped the same for you to grab it for dinner tonight so very exciting place oh thank you that's on my dragon its tail is because July lives don't had very long naps today dogs going to take her out in the pram plus they go out I'm going to get some skills are you gonna count every time okay let's talk about my camera upgrade quickly this is my um old one I bought this almost four years ago now I got the canon 600d I very rarely use the kit lens that comes with this instead I use my Sigma 45 mil lens but this camera was getting very kind of old and there was a lot of stuff that it just really couldn't do that you really kind of want from a camera as a vlogger so that is why I upgraded to the Canon 700d they look pretty much identical this one is a little bit lighter but I cannot tell you how glad I am that I got this for two things mainly autofocus when film in this camera doesn't have autofocus when you film so that absolutely fine for the video dry sit down and I put myself in focus issues in my laptop and I also wouldn't want autofocus and whilst using this lens if I just sat here like this talking to you guys because this lens it's very clumpy and with the autofocus it's really noisy so I would want it to sat but filming things like clothes on myself so if I did a clothing haul and I wanted to film the clothing on me filming that with my old camera was just was just a nogo but now I've upgraded to the 700d I can do that I can autofocus I was still film and my sit down videos with my Sigma lens because I loved it but earlier when I first spoke in this video when I was doing my makeup I use this camera with a kit lens it was auto focusing and you can't hear it this is so quiet this is becoming very longwinded but basically this is lifesaver for me it saved me so much time when it comes to filming all my little cutaways for my videos but the other features I'm happy about is the fact it has touch screen I can now touch on the screen to what I want to focus on which again just makes life so much easier it makes filming so much quicker so if I've got the camera in front of me here I can flip the screen round and I can just change the settings here on the screen rather than having to fiddle around with them here yeah it's basically same camera but I can use touch screen and it has autofocus while still meant those two little things just make my life so much easier I'm so so happy with it I am going to set up for film in usually I have to I have my laptop here plugged into my camera to then be able to see whether I'm in focus all I have to do now is make sure I'm sat down where I want to set be sat down and then tackle my face and it will focus on my face there like that Dada I can turn off the auto focus and I will still be in focus except the I don't want to also focus in with this lens because it's noisy hit record and it will just keep me a practice like this so much easier apparently I'm a very exciting at in subjective I have more done empties video it's such a long time that's a wrap for filming I am now going to make a start on dinner so with Barry I upgraded my fridge we know how we love a new fridge and I can fit so much more in it than I used to with my other ones babies that's a very Dicky swine did you ask me to change into some much comfier clothing I'm going to make a start on dinner and I'm going to show you the last two things that we recently got from very one of them you guys have already seen if you follow me on my blogging channel it is this lovely which it is a retro style Swampert check the fridge freezer like our other one except the freezer is on the top and we have the slightly messy but very packed fridge along of the bottom our old for it was just a secondhand one that does got for that pounds which was signing it did the job but it has a massive dent hot side and there were barely any shelves in there and there were no drawers or anything so you couldn't fit much in it and there's a little bit smaller and there is no way of really organizing bits and bobs so I'm so much happier with this one we can fit so much more into this fridge freezer it's so much more organized and yet just my last things which are also pitching related are our juggling new cast iron pot and pan I've always loved cooking and so things like a good pot and pan makes it very excited so we've got these two they're from the same same ground and same line I love the wooden handles I'm actually going to use this saw spoon tonight some and put that there and I got them in this lovely sage color so I just really like what they look like we've got them a couple of weeks ago and I've been cooking with them every single day they're such good quality and then actually nonstick it is just completely up my cooking game I'm in a void of cooking but I dug and I got really lazy since their sister later came along it got to a point where we were just go into the supermarket every day and buy ready meals I won Miss chicken and if this isn't very healthy and it's also a lot more expensive I am going to make this I've made this once before and it was really quick and easy this is black olives tomato and lentil pasta I'll pop this recipe in the description so you can them go through it properly I've just popped some olive oil in there and then tell me so far and then once I printed up I'm going to put that mixture in that we just blend it up now as you can see just need to add some water you need to bring that to boil and then once it's boiling turn it down to simmer also when I said I've been doing a lot more cooking recently I really have because I've also been I'm doing some sort of batch batch cooking making soups and pasta sauces and yeah I've been there in a little bit crazy Silas with hot sauce in business so I'm going to finish dinner or learning to add now on my lentils just stirring the sauce into the pasta do have a little bit left over some big enough up for lunch tomorrow okay so I'm going to talk into pasta we're going to watch Graham Lawton before I go thanks so much very for collaborating with me I'm always so grateful to work with brands I love and use its system it's a bonus working with people that you love hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you again on this channel soon for kind of a normal phenomenal video for this channel it will probably be my my empties videos took too long it's been all cute book stir topped up for sleep which probably stop talking some income went to her you"	2314

video and love these because they're like little like loafers are like half loafers half sandals and I just think they're really cute hi everyone so it's my day too and I feel so ill and my cold is just like got so much worse overnight I just woke up and I'm like so blocked up and sneezy and snotty and just feel like really headache and tired and something cuz I've wanted to come to Mexico like my whole life and I've got here and I've got cold and bad it's not great but I'm I think I'm going to go down have some breakfast now it had a bit of a lion and yeah catch you later hi everyone and I haven't really been vlogging very much on this holiday because I got here and I instantly got like the most awful cold and I couldn't stop sneezing I was literally like I've never sneezed that much before in my life and it's so hot here like I don't know how many degrees is but it's like two always so hot that it's unbearable and so when you've got a cold as well I just didn't feel good at all so I didn't really want to vlog but I'm going to try and vlog more now obviously I would have really done it before so if this does go up it will be my first vlogging video and but yeah we've just

this Grail restaurant literally on the beach so pretty the sun's just messing yeah traps exactly you hi everyone so today is a new day and we're doing something very exciting today I'm swimming with dolphins and I wanted to do this my whole life so I'm ridiculously excited we're in this beautiful place and I think it's a lagoon because I'm a bit like funny with you know like being cruel to animals and stuff but I know these dolphins are in a lagoon not like a pool so I think it is a bit better I'm just so excited it's just me and my family in the pool with them I'm oh my god I've actually lost them oh my goodness okay I'm just going to go this way I think is this way oh my god I physically lost them I found my sister so I'm not completely lost sailors Coco hello excited yeah we're the dolphin team is love so I'm probably going to stop filming now because we can't take our cameras in but hopefully I'll be able to edit and the footage that they give us yes I will hopefully edit in excited yeah see you later you fuck hi everyone and it's my last night tonight which is really sad and my sisters in the bath can you see I just wanted to say because I'm probably going to have included some footage of me swimming with the dolphins in this vlog but I posted a photo to Instagram of me kissing the dolphin and there were loads of really negative comments about it and I assume is probably going to be some negative comments in this video as well which is why I want to say it and I was a bit upset because I felt like everyone was making me out to be like this really evil person who supports animals being in captivity and that's not true at all we were a bit skeptical about it because my mum's a vegetarian and really is a massive animal lover but we went along and we were really really pleasantly surprised the Dolphins admittedly did not really have enough space but basically what it was it was actually in the sea and they just closed off with piles and piles of rocks but they had like a and how to explain it like a gateway where the sea was constantly flowing in so it was natural seawater and also lots of people say that the dolphins only do tricks because they're hungry because there's no food but there were plenty literally hundreds of fish and swimming around in the enclosure that they can eat these dolphins have pretty much all been born in captivity which I don't know if that makes it better or worse personally I think it's better because what I really don't agree with his dolphins being torn away from their families in the wild and then put into an enclosure that's obviously awful but a lot of those dolphins have moms and grandmas in the same centre and the train is clearly like absolutely adore them all of the trainer's that were so so lovely and just was so in love with these dolphins it was like they were their children and Mexico for the part that I am in the Mayan Riviera are so ecofriendly they are obsessed with the environment and the animals and the wildlife and they take really good care of it they really truly care about the environment and the ecosystem and everything you know I'm not allowed to wear some cream in the pool and sorry in the bit racing with the dolphins so even though I get where people coming from I had such a lovely day I loved seeing the dolphins and if anything it's given me way more respect for them after having been around them and seen how intelligent they are and what they can do and I would just appreciate it if people wouldn't condemn me for going on that excursion with my family that's my little rant over again I'm really sorry if I offended anyone I don't anyone to think I'm a bad person and yes I'll may be booked tomorrow but if not I will take by now and Osie back in London okay guys I know that I've logged tonight already but I came into my room and just finish packing and I'm stood here and I just saw like a flash like a shadow over on the wall over there so I walked over there and I've just seen like this orange lizard on the wall like this big so not massive and I've gone and it's obviously seen me and it's darted so fast always as if I didn't actually see it but there's no way that I'm ever going to catch it was so fast so tonight I'm going to do because I'm not going to be able to sleep but I can't try and catch it like I don't even know where it is right now I'm going to say night now because I've said good night like three times today but I'm gonna risk all my fire until my dad gets back good night you"	2327

through what's happening on this trip and what I need to do that by bus and I was just like whoa huh but I remember being beautiful anyway forget this day going shall we so it sounds like there isn't

sushi two chopsticks in there I'm now going to eat everything as I'm absolutely starving let's do a workout in fact because the jetlag I'm okay at the moment but I've got two hours I reckon pull and jetlag really kicks in and I get sleepy so with your workout now and and then just kind of hang and is it worth in the room before going up at dinner this evening so I don't think I'm going to take you to my workout so it's getting really twisted in fact I might stop filming today now because I'm making this into one video so obviously there's traveling here and today and the actual show and everything so I might just stop today right now and to shower and well because I'm very expected you want our stuff I think I'll shower after a workout there's no point in Florida anyway see you in a bit Hogan afternoon so I've got most of the day to kill which is lovely about an event tonight it's like a really intimate dinner because it's so intimate and I'm not going to take my camera I'm not sure who's going to be there and or film things so for most ancient kills this morning I woke up for earlier did Pilates now plus it is digital I never really know before I had one go my personal trainer Joffrey better over time he has mark a performer who's like the Machine you can get on it's basically all about aligning and strengthening you must work worth a lot of exercises are all about contracting it was about kind of lengthening out and I'm not very stretchy and it's mostly for bass and oh my god you're nagging me but really good I know that are going to be I'm gonna be a lot of pain all my like a bleep subside I'm kidding you're ready yeah really good has breakfast it isn't work on my laptop and now the Ripper wanna get food and the well guess who's I'm relative so that's to fish off wonderful thing and all I've had in Turkish miracle very heavily right there on our way to lunch we were decide to walk because due to everything Tom said it was a half an hour walk okay look into that lovely we've been walking for 15 minutes so far and it still staying with 40 minutes to go I am starving and then Richard is just subtly in conversation just say no if you want to get any we can so it was quite a way to go we matched it and we still got like 45 minutes but now we're already kind of on the roll so we're just going to keep walking I might have to go a shade yeah I'm already read bit well ours is early as we get dude I think I was about to film my food in the end I think partly because I was just writing project focus my blog but I think I was so in my hangar zone I didn't want talked when you want to do anything so I just like I jumped it all my face really good with a pencil Santina which does sort of like Italian food but sort of coastal Italians or like they do are in the amount eCos wonderful thing you have so I had a really beautiful calamari salad with rice to make rubbings and now I'm full it just gives a bit more energy which I think I'm going to need your car now off this forum I'm trying to make my makeup done so very bad for hotel now today is shown by which has been on with your walking basically all day planted in water this morning walk back did a bit like me off any office in the downstairs area of the hotel then walked all that work on hunting all the way back again and now it's like five o'clock I have to go again at 7:45 I'm going to block our also just a chilled so I get ready okiedokie them everybody time to head out to dinner this suit is really really nice it's hard to see in this light but you saw at the beginning of this video and how my campaigns in London it's just a really gifted cat Navy doublebreasted suit with peak lapels and it's lovely I'm sorry not to go to the tie or pocket square to kind of cash it down a bit and also boiling outside it didn't wanna as complicated too much here you can see in this mirror the mirror is a bit dark and poverty but I kind of have my and trans got a bit shorter just to get it and come out because it's something anyway like I said I'm not going to take you guys to the party with me cuz apparently very into much this event and so I feel like me suddenly talking to a camera might kind of ruin that intimate by a little bit so I guess I'll see you tomorrow when all the actual happens a bit nervous actually I'm doing me I'm posting a live show and I haven't had a runthrough yet I think I have a runthrough tomorrow morning so I know kind of how these things happen and I've done live things a million times before I used to do a lot of red carpet for films and things like that and the premiere do stuff and I haven't done them for a while just because I haven't had a time to do this because also going to take rehearsal and all that stuff and I haven't been able to find that time to do it so I'm a bit I'm done one for a wee while you know this alternative election with Joan casters and that was Christmas plan I think but I've got other live things it's a nice thing for Mercedes not long ago and you know I'm alright as ever doing it for a while and Alec I know I'm doing but I do get nervous before hand I'm also going to be into doing lots of celebrity apparently I've been given a headshot list basically you know faces and Alexander Skarsgard there Chris and Chris Hemsworth there who are five or six major alist who's which is fine I don't get nervous about that bit so much is just one get nervous about holding the whole thing together basically this whole ice cream you know hinges on me I'm the guy you know making sure things run smoothly and the next thing leads on to the next thing and then I you know it's a lot to think about so I think I'm going to early night tonight make sure I'm on good form tomorrow anyway I will see you tomorrow um yeah do tomorrow good morning so Tuesday today today the time is about 8 a.m. open up for a while because actually like it was not ready and also before I do things on it so would get bit no that's the struggle to sleep so I got like six and running things through my head and stuff and I'm here at the door behind me the showing of the starts are like one but I think we've got a few things to film and we go live like a couple hours before the show get people ready and then show happen and as I've been after the show too so I hope you've done by like two which because I know that I'm going to be starving but I never eat gonna do these things I get too nervous and it's so much adrenaline running and then suddenly I start crashing so I'm thinking about to it and I'm going like eat a burger accompany them feel great right let's do it okay so I'm at the venue it's very early I would use not many people here but it'll look come on whoa watch it might be deafening so we're in place called Olson market which I don't know what it is not New York but I'm it's a big building and it's a really cool you are shot the other day where you thought sort of in your in my jumper the show you over there appeared through that window then anyway so what can you want me to say did you come up here but you see big cube robot that and then you come around this way and there's another one there and then you walk through this is a big big I have you seen a catwalk this side in all my time doing flashing things here we have the camera crew and everything you'll be filming a whole thing over lights as a be more people than I think the catwalk goes right down there and then it goes right that there left and right down again now in London I reckon the capital 12 out 3/4 the length this straight in the first thing what happened is the models walk along catwalk come around the corner and then I go out this door here and walk the whole way along the outside it's really cool setup so I'm it's funny whenever I come around by backstage and behind the themes or Basinger way the made an hour last minute everything is maybe saying up the chairs now think nothing nothing's ready yet but it will be you've got a few hours yet and it means remarkably calm back going backstage now I'll show you there's not many people there everyone knows that what it's doing it's really to your house expecting four models and madness and mayhem and you know people running around like that surely everyone just knows their jobs and they're getting on with it massive taking the ages to walk in and I'm either walking it like really relaxed I'm not actually you know trying to hold everything in and look like I'm a model and being all sexy stuff so for the model though much is quite nerveracking you know I walked without saying about a plastic mug do and there's a very short nap so you get nothing realer generally but this I think people are not kinda chilly about them wearing off become aware what's going on to the big screen here and you come backstage it shows what's going on here we have a wall I think we're all the most occasions in that Henty area there but I my makeup now is also Templar and green room and then back here these rails are going to be where the looks are and you've got loads of people doing their job loads of makeup stand here so I get all the model get their makeups done and then obviously all team boss over there is doing that thing it's getting with you we are to mine to our Georgia okay you say two hours our clothes are being unpacked models are getting it models of really attractive I always liked Midori ugly and all those are all having their hair makeup done still remarkably calm in here I think our mission is impossible I think that made a lot of show you never have I ever want to ruin this muscle face so I think because of the columns if people are coming for location show so yeah so far so moves I've been given a drone login old lens drugs I've never flown a drone before and I let it go before I'm not very good and and it's like really expensive and they want to meet like champion charlo terrifying but I think that's right didn't crash it good I did at one point kind of take it off the edge of the building by accident and then are we like quite a few thought oh my god I drop it now because it goes I see and plan there it's half the good do you think is a lot complete the game we go up down left and right you've got like safety you can move that around you can turn left and right you can do up and down and forward or backwards and all those things combined give you like a whole cream sixteen men their rehearsals are just starting but be quick we're going to miss things there's not loads of look essentially is happening now in order to coming out in the same tshirt just like continuity positive and not so sort through any of it of now I'm going to follow this guy you gotta look straight ahead and be aggressive basically look Rudy I'm quite intentional there's only a few people watching rehearsals but already that you know I've got my heart going okay everybody I haven't spy for you guys

"yes_WEEKLY VLOG #110  BOXING & THE ADDAMS FAMILY"	"hello everybody welcome to another weekly vlog it is half past four and I have been at Benji's house this morning and most the weekend I came back from Croatia on Saturday afternoon has the most amazing holiday ever I've been working all weekend on the vlog so hopefully you've enjoyed that that'll be up Friday for me I've done the trailer that goes up tonight and I've done the bulk of it it's just adding in the music and cutting it down a bit because it's an hour and minutes long eventually I had the best time at the best time is so great a really awesome experience Croatia was so pretty and I've been very refreshed and ready to get back into a routine however whilst I was away Benji had my boyfriend he has hurt his knee and he's actually quite poorly bless him so I can't tell you what the exact name is working for getting it but he's basically got a very inspected swollen knee to the point man you can't walk carpet pressure on it and he has to have elevators for 10 to 14 days and he is not working moment he he's an electrician and I think he didn't do anything in particular to hurt it but I think leaning down on his knees being on his means so much you'd obviously done something to it and and anyway it's infected that he's on antibiotics he's on painkillers he's looked that's quite a little bit but please in good spirits so I am nurse T and I'm looking after them where I can although it's very weird to people on normal looking after me and making sure I'm okay and cooking for me and things like that and now at role reversal and I'm enough for him which I don't know if I'm very good up I think you just appreciate my company because there's only so many games of Call of Duty and FIFA you can play or your brain is a bit like frazzled I think so we started a new puzzle today this afternoon I work eight to one and my freelance stuff while pretty much next week and then we started the puzzle and now I'm on my way to my mum's house because I have I could see her because I only came back passionate yet and B I need forgot some parcels apparently my friend Kevin in LA some of you watched for a long time

it vinyl for love island tonight which I'm very excited about I didn't miss it as much as I thought I work to be honest because I hadn't seen it for a whole week I would really like Cameron amber to win or come in and Jamie I think chemin amber deserve to win finished blood like me I don't know how to like give this constructive criticism really I did really like it and it's nice to finish the book I do like Louise the style of writing she is quite funny however I just found the characters too similar to her own life so I found myself relating Robyn to Louise and Lila Darcy and I just think that that we should maybe Anna can do one let me but I'd love to see her write something a bit more of her comfort zone I'm not sure I know that we've had an amazing like imagination of the word I was looking for she had a great imagination so yeah I'd like to read something from habit not to related to her own life I just find I was comparing it home sorry I did like it it wasn't my favorite book I've ever read but I just like any price to read a whole book finish a book okay my hair looks great good morning I'm just having a ball of shreddies before I'm off to boxing's morning do it Harris in boxing yes and basically go try boxing at ten o'clock this morning half an hour cause I know I'm going to be any good at but I'm going to go the best exercise try it last night a drone can one love Island which was great throw onto them for them we played a lego city abort ng and Xbox games that we can play together or I made spaghetti bolognaise outside what's math table for lunch today I've just finished boxing and it was so good I'm exactly if I did it I told the instructor and then was Ross and I told him I was a complete newbie I'm out of touch at the gym I'm trying to find classes I like and I'm very unfit and he was like no problems I told him I've done certain classes and I done personal training and I've been at the gym for a while but I've lost my mojo and he was like us so finds class is really good for you because half an hour and it's really in setup a boy strength so that I can get back into doing weightlifting as well and go back to my iron do classes I quite like but I've just I'm so out of touch and I put on so much weight that I just need to start from the bottom and work up I can expect myself to be thrown back into classes I used to do that I like an hour long so boxing with half an hour you pair me up with a girl called Tara she was so nice she's done like full hearted so she was quite me herself and we basically swapped from being like pulling the punches to doing the punches and we also had weights and we did a warm up with some free weights at dumbbells it was good Bert hard but really really good I'm betting I've been next week in fact I'm going to put myself in because then I will go again okay so you have to ignore my hair I've just come out the shower a little bit frizzy but I wanted to show you now how battery in my camera the parcels that I was sent yesterday without showing you my address so the first one I'm very excited about because this is a company that I've been talking to for a while and I'm going to be working with over the next few months they're called road filled watches the website comes up in dollars but they do ship Internet for free and if you click in the top left then it comes up you can change it into pounds I'm going to show you what they've sent me I'm very excited thank you yeah oh this is so cute it's obviously packaged I have the press release in front of me I basically picked two watches and then I have four bracelets yeah from the new downtown chic collection so it said it's a fine jewelry line consisting of seven different designs 15 different bracelets to add that extra edge to your wrist they come in different colors you've got gold silver and rose gold they're really gorgeous so everything I want to start wishing to watch it I love my jewelry as you can see and I have been in the market for a new watch something I can wear to blogger event to dinners Allen things this one's from the Upper East Side collection it's 99 pounds or the packaging bag that's one key oh look at that so that's the first watch I'll link everything below so you can go and have a look I'm a real silver jewelry girl as you can see so I was really excited for this one it comes with all the bits to adjust it so I will have a play with that in a minute and then the next book I picked was from the West Village collection I am in love of this so this one's 89 pound and it's got a velvet strap I still have a tag on but that fits so beautifully look how nice that is I love it now you've seen the two watches I picked I'm going to move on to show you the jewelry to match okay seven different bracelet in the collection and I have two in two different colors I've gone for silver and gold this are called Christy and it's available in gold and silver I just thought these were really like delicate and pretty and really easy to wear so what I imagined is having the gold bracelets with the gold watch and then I also have one called Worcester which is in gold silver needles do rose rose gold in this one and it's really simple bangle with a little Rose filled tag on it so I have quite big wrists and I often like find I've got a bangle and this on I just have to slide quite harshly on and off where this has a really nice little clasp there we go that's the Worcester bracelet as well I really like that that looks so nice together so I have a few of my own bracelets on here but I also have the Roseville ones in between here in the middle which I absolutely love they make a really nice addition and I like that you can pair up or you can mix metals there we go I've created my own downtown chic style all I need to do is find the right place to wear them you'll probably see me sell this in another weekly vlog I think with a little black dress and maybe some gold hills this would be such a lovely addition I really love them the Worcester the solid gold this 149 pound and then the crispy that the it's like a solid line and then a chain detailing and it goes the way around

know I went to Disney out in California for the day by myself when I did my track ISM my last day before I went flew home and I met this guy called Kevin and he now works at Disney which is crazy at the time he wasn't he was just going around the park on his own and we ended up well he basically changed my whole trip and he was a bit of a guardian angel said to me that day anyway I'll link that blog below if you want to watch it if you haven't seen already especially if you're a Disney fan especially want to see what does my California is like for the day you send each other thing and he asks my address again reasoning Oh although this looks very Disney the Mickey lollipop thank you Kevin days are going to get eaten up some more sweet pea goofy sour candies I'm going to Bengie you'll love these we could take the systemically oh this is a little mini lanyard spinner gasps oh it says live love and relax that is so me see look Kevin knows me so well look at that it's Mickey in the bar that's sweet oh my godness it's a mod is it a mug I'm opposed come all the way over from LA Oh oh my god it's like a channel one oh look at it okay I'm not so nice that's so ideal so it's basically a mug which I actually love and then it's got its own little like travel bit on the top I'm going to take this to Benji's house because I don't have my own mug there yes I spend a lot of time there so I'm gonna have it there oh that's so nice well Kevin thank you very much for my gift they were very sweet of you but some sweetie the god pin badge it's not even my birthday not Christmas so I'm now going to pick up some things for Kevin to turn back to him I'm going to think about it if any of you have any bright ideas of what I can send Kevin back let me know but anyway Oh might as well show you the Primark passes well I'm here Primark cool the picked up another pair of little black shoes these are like three pound fifty so I don't even care too much if I only get like a few uses at them but I really like those and then I got to disney tops i tried on all of those ones i showed you and the white ones are such poor quality you could see through them and i just didn't like the fit however I did full enough of this grey one which says Mickey Mouse and there's three little Mickey's on that and I thought just a tshirt this was eight pounds and then I saw this pink one that was folded up as well I saw this one for this was four pounds I might wear this to the park I might wear as a pajama top but either way I really liked it bright pink it says Minnie Mouse then I got this little top which I really like which I was considering when to the stair to tomorrow this is very me it was eight pounds and is just spotty and it's a little bit floaty so it looks really nice on I tried on and it was really happy with it looked really pretty I like this kind of detailing on the top and then also I got two pairs of shoes for Florida so I needed some new trainers I can walk around in all day in Florida and I like these because they are red with flowers or they're white with red flowers on it and because I'm going to be wearing mini is I thought this would look quite cute so these were 12 pounds and they are really comfortable and if you can see that they look quite a lot of padding and around them it looks really nice on and I just think they'll go with so many things so I do have my AB gasps gazelles I think I'm going to take as well but maybe I'll just do the gazelles and just wear these because they'll just go with everything and so the XO and then I also picked up these which is basically what I went in for loads of you sent me pictures of these now I bought a really cute pair of pretty much the same style shoe in Disney print and they afford Minnesota didn't think anything of it took them home and they will massive on me I'm normally a size 7 but primaries come up in weird sizes I could put these and dolly shoes in a 7 I don't know why these are made slightly big so I tried on the six and they fitted perfectly these were eight pounds and they basically like converse style Disney shoes I actually prefer this print because they'll go with anything the other ones had like red and yellow all of them so I like these because they're black and white really really cute for Florida so they're basically going to what I'm going to be wearing these and these are going to be my Florida shoes and so exciting as you can tell her my planning for the trip so yeah that's everything I bought I'm just going to put that back next bag and I'll show my mum don't you just call me and he's feeling his knees a lot better he got up and we went saying together and he pushed the trolley so instead of using his crutches or being in a wheelchair he used the trolley to lean on and today he made me a cup of tea this morning as well which is really nice because I was working on the Med photo blog post or LM alone think you can be back and work on Monday and the weekend we're going to get up walking and getting getting a bit stronger so we to the moment so tonight we're going to go to the cinema I'm not sure it's like we're probably

as you can see O'Neill clubs have a limited edition side a menu with loads of really awesome and sliders tried so we had a few and they were delicious having a really nice and safe RV a caesarian Israeli night sweet again we're trying different items my favorites like that difficulty my nickel free so there's been a long time remaining voice acting to come on yes I have just got in from our dinner at O'Neill's and we had a really nice time they ended up having an open mic and live music and it created a really nice atmosphere the beer garden was really popular there were loads of people out there it was a little bit chilly for us so we ate inside but that'd be such a nice place to go and sit after work have drinks with your colleagues or friends it's a really nice pub vibe so he had great selection of the menus super affordable and the sliders were so young they had two four seven pounds so really affordable as well I genuinely had a really great time and I can definitely see myself going back there was a really big O'Neill's in Bournemouth really great stars as well at one point we had our starter and the waitress came over and she we were still like nibbling on the last it's the nachos and she was like are you ready for your man yet and I just thought that was such nice service for like a pub you know like they really surprised me and the bar started there two guys they were really friendly honestly genuinely really liked it and I would definitely be going back so thank you very much O'Neill's for working with me and inviting me to come and try the new sliders my favourites always going to be a cock burg that has my heart but I really did like the Smirnoff one and this one was another favorite of mine Rosie pig's flat tyre sparkling cloudy cider with rhubarb I really liked this one I've never seen this before so it's really cool that they have some like this on their menu I'm now going to take my makeup off and wash my face and get into bed and read a book and I will see you tomorrow morning I am off to the office where I work out today for the company I work for is their office today because I'm getting some new clients I think I'm gonna be

going to make carbonara finish our D so I'll take him on days like today make me really appreciate not having to a make up and being honest jamas and not having cleared to work I do like the idea of getting up and going and having routine cause I used to do that for so long but I much prefer the situation I have now almost ready to go to work which is very weird to me but I'm watching my friend Tamsin something you might remember Tamsin actually because we are really good friend Susan friends for a long time and she moved back to Essex and she's had a baby and she's engaged and she's also making new two videos again so I'm going to link Tamsin below please subscribe to her I'm on weekly real number one but she actually has done cheese I need to catch up with that one as well but yeah she's so lovely came out when it was like limited you'll really like her she's so genuine and just like downtoearth and really nice girl so yeah that's Tamsin and then I wanted to show you I have packed myself some snacks in this little lunch bags I got from home bargain I've got like a cat priest on a yoga that's going off today cereal bar and some biscuits for the office and I'm going to have a cup of tea and I've also got my lava and water ball so my laptop and what else have I got it only shit my tails and it's in here and love this little bag there's a mini bag either cute and then I'll be ready to go and my Karen isn't Tamsin so I know it's very Sarah typical English of me to moan about the weather but this is August it's absolutely horrible I just got soaked luckily I picked up my raincoat today but I'm wearing tights and we saw I'm wearing and my legs are freezing so anyway two o'clock now just finished work I had a really good day went really quickly and I'm going to go

it needs to be repaired again but I'm just going to hang that there for second your mum and put back on so toilet paper I'm quite fast me about my new role and I like it to be quilted I think my mum instilled this in me a while ago but and yeah I'd buy the Aldi one is only like a two pound 20 or something I think for wilted Twitter arm comparison to other supermarket is actually quite cheap one pound 49 before so after that Colibri argument will depending I've had with film tonight cucumber some salmon for my dinner tomorrow night raspberries perhaps strawberry this week and I fancy pressing L drainage cake bar I thought they'd be quite good when I'm craving some sugar I just have one of these when I was a chocolate bar creme fraiche to make carbonara tonight and the Parmesan cheese go with it I picked up a little rice puddings I thought this would also be quite good dessert when I want sugar and it arrived pudding with a bit of jam my childhood memories come and got some bread to go with our carbonara tonight we normally get garlic bread but I just picked up where we're seeing much to go in my sermon mix vegetables because I also live alone it's a way for me to buy all the individual ones so I just buy it in a like mixed medley bag myself to get my veggies in my freezers not big enough to freeze bed you've got peas and stuff in there but I can't have all of the carrots and broccoli and stuff pancetta to have in a carbonara I also got these avenging eye because they're little so I thought they're not as bad as like a big ice cream and they're calories so they're just little Oreo lollies I just thought they'd be quite nice to have I found me extra white gum I'm going to actually take that back out of my car and it come to the thing that you click on so you can have

"yes_WHAT I WORE at the British Seaside"	"good morning so today's vlog is coming to you from a very sunny Whitstable Charlie and I decided to bring our two little chaps on their first UK staycation together and we decided to come to Whitstable it's in I didn't actually know where it was before I hope you I'd check them out sing Kent in the Southeast of England we took a southeastern train to get here from some Pancras and it only took an hour and 12 minutes it was one of their fast trains so it feels like not even that long ago that we're having breakfast in the station and suddenly we're out of the city enjoying the fresh Beach seaside air and we've just checked in to the marine hotel is where we're staying really lovely little room dogfriendly which is the most important thing and we're just about to take the boys down to the beach even Dexter's never been to the beach before so it's gonna be so nice to see if he can swim I'm just kidding he's definitely not gonna go and see um but it's gonna be really nice to take them down to the beach and neither Charlie nor I have been twistable before so we kind of were just looking at a map where to southeastern trains go and Whitstable just caught our eyes so we've chosen our dates really well it says it's degrees actually it feels more like degrees here so we're just going to get changed with my travel outfit and going to explore the town on the seaside with our a little chat what do you think boys should we go to the seaside shall we go to the seaside come on in let me get changed so our hotel is literally right on the beachfront it's a little promenade behind me this is the view from the other direction it's so still today even the wind turbines in the distance aren't even moving which makes me really tempted to try some paddleboarding I think we're going to have a look in the town and see what's on offer so we have walked around 20 minutes down the kind of coastal pathway with the dogs and I think now we're in a town called town kitten so we need to go one street back to find the high street I'm still craving my terms it really will find a good chippies basically we haven't made any particular plans aside from half thinking about what pub we go things night for dinner so yeah we're just going to take it take it easy with these little day trips all about try to through taking photos off these colorful huts I didn't realize that these yeah like beach huts versus realizing the winds picked up you probably can't hear me but yeah we're going to Kerala exploring start making a when I get my chance okay so I'm officially one very happy girlie I've got my fish and chips or technically I've got my back sausage and chips on the seaside with my three boys thanks to sunbathing the consistent shade whether you go darling ciao scoffs Campion chips European I've got my bachelor search it's amazing to think that this type of tranquillity is just over an hour out of London okay so you know how I said a minute ago that Dexter wouldn't be going in to see well now has already changed so Dexter just decided to have her till after a massive seagull continued to follow him into the sea and he's now a very wet puppy dog these two little rascals so naughty jellies now having to carry a very wet Dexter come here Rooney my sake boy Georgia little chap have you been for a swim little man there you've been swim not sure if you can see me because it's so lovely and bright outside but Charlie Dexter Dickens and I have now just come back to our hotel the marine and we're in there Orangery this lovely bright conservatory and we're doing a little bit of work as you guys know bloggers on holiday just basically working in a nicer place in our living room so China I think and our laptops however I've got a glass of Pimm's as you must do when you're on holiday and Charlie has got a local hard core and then I've got little Dicky fast asleep on my lap I think human Dexter are absolutely exhausted from their long walk and our fish and chips by the sea Dexter is going to have to have a bath later she has got seaweed stuck to his tail but yeah it's in a really lovely afternoon so we're just catching up on a few emails now and we're going to quickly freshen up and head out into town look for a nice restaurant for dinner and just explore even more so I'm going to crack on with your mouth and I'll see you later a flight DejaVu Ali and I are now dressed for dinner very smart not very beachy attire without the yapping without the two pooches so Charlie and I are taking the Beach route that we took a minute ago with the dogs hopefully the iPhone footage wasn't too horrendous but it's kind of this beautiful golden hour now look at this view behind me oh it's gonna be the most incredible sunset and because this is beautiful lighting and it's going to be hot tomorrow we thought we'd come down now and take some photos all these little beach huts I don't know why but I didn't think that Whitstable had these hearts to do um I didn't think about it but yeah I mean every beach chassis so hard I'm stunning her we had a little nosey inside what and what kind of like crane darn ecstacy inside one earlier and you can actually sit a lot in them this guy had like a TARDIS oh yeah a little hammocks a little kitchen area and this amazing balcony I mean imagine just opening your doors on one of these huts and having your morning coffee with that view he got us thinking about the gorge clock and they made faces yeah and what you could do I mean I think there was one with the beach shop sure you could do you could have you know like bed that changes into a kitchen counter yeah and they would be so much cheaper here than like Brighton or Market or anything they would I don't know I know it's got quite an expensive feeling but there are such cute colors there was one that was like a refresh as part of it was pink and yellow so hopefully he will be able to find that get some nice photos and then I think Charlie's craving oysters for dinner and we're better than the British seaside so see what we can find look at the concentration on this max good going back at the hotel Charlie looks like something out of a horror film I'm not gonna lie he's got one of those oh my goodness that's actually really scary if it's one of those face masks it makes him look like a cat as you can see I've got a load of oil on my face it's what I feel my skin needs tonight I think it's going to be a case of four in the bed tonight because Dexter just jumps up on the bed anyway and then Dickens cries when he's the only one not in the bed so I don't think Charlie and I gonna get terribly good night's sleep but this evening's meal was delicious we kind of just walked through the town and this place called birdies was really full there were loads of people in there which is always a good sign we did do kind of a lap of the town which looks really cute definitely going to go back and explore the town a bit more tomorrow but I had a Filat Wellington for my mane and it was delicious Charlie had a seafood broth kind of thing and then we beasts and then we shared a Whitstable mess instead of an Eton Mess and it was crummy so highly recommend birdies if you come down so yeah I'm gonna catch up with you guys in the morning time to snuggle with my three little boys well Charlie's not little um so I'll see you in the morning good morning it is our second day here in Whitstable Charlie and I had a lovely night's sleep cuddling up with our two little sausages I woke up with one sausage on either side both lying on their backs just brotherly love and I actually woke up at 6 o'clock came down to the beach at 6:30 to take the boys out for their morning ablutions and it was so stunning I just had this whole scenery to myself nobody else around it was one of those really lovely moments but Chas and I have now left the hotel we had breakfast at the hotel very scenic looking out onto the ocean had a full English and Charlie had some local Haddix had it had act havoc Benedict we are now out and about again making the mostest gorgeous weather we are just walking to which town we've just explored Hampton High Street and now we're heading to the town which we kind of saw last night but everything was shut because obviously they see so town's everything shuts quite early so we're just making most supporters whether walking there now with the two boys probably going to be about 45 minute walk but a very scenic one begins so we've spent the past couple of hours exploring Whitstable high street it's a very cute little high street lots of nice coffee shops we went into a florist and bought a new plant rotten went into a pet store sadly no harnesses for the right size for dickens and then we walked along the harbor where there's loads of like kind of popup store type things and get oyster and fish and chips some are more rustic than others let's just say but how are the oysters darling yeah they were really good I actually really liked oysters now why never you very brave no but yeah I think the often hated with a bit yesterday them enemies really good for you as well well thickens each other at my feet as always and so yeah we're walking back towards ten kitten bay now which is where the hotel is and it's about half two now I think we're going to aim to get a train at about half three so we're just going to make our way back I might try and show you my outfit although you have seen most of these elements ashore and at the beach hut that is painted like swizzles and matte low colors you'll see I mean you bastard you better be fair when I shake watch me rock if I can't stop I should fall okay so sadly the time has come when we are making our way back home proper to you boys with me on this side you can't even see Dickon little travel carry case which is just one of the best 20 pounds I think I've ever spent yeah starts believing Whitstable up in just over an hour we will be back home again thanks to this speedy southeastern train service with a very scenic view okay that's so typical it was a beach you're thinking to go but yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed coming along to Whitstable with us our new information on how to get here where we stay and all that chance down below so I'm going to sign off now thank you so much for watching give a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you racing"	2124

today is qualifying and I've loved yesterday I learned so much about when we won that I never even knew which I'm going to try guys and charger or Luke is right there with the rocks icon bob is realized either cookies Walker in the world you know is that pleased so far so look here you just look clunky Bob we're in a massive hurry to get to I think a tender which always thought vent chicken tenders we've been you hungry whatever it's not Maria boy we go no sorry I would avoid the avoided Porsche I would smell so much right in Merida Ferrari oh we're eat like oh look at this this really is Betty luxury it's finest clothes decided guys I'm going to at some point in my life own a boat there's maybe one like that probably I'm going to live on a boat I don't get seasick which is quite rare well what makes I don't get seasick so I decided I'm just destined to live on a boat also I'd be so on edge upon those buildings up there I might not vote on a boat Danielle where we do hey I hate a movie nowhere we made it onto the plate in time and we're about to have a crash Captain Jack Perry's coming in to clear out though your Altima crash since that is a cool boat this is like some sort of scene from parts of the Caribbean this is Luke right here's the main man is in charge of Williams William is rated and is about the man that told me everything I know yesterday about for Milan is also the fastest Walker then did it in didn't didn't enjoy in Formula One but Jack he loved his Formula One and he's emailing minute we showing it right now but he's having the time of his life he's trying to wave himself playing Captain Jack this is a no world honestly Oh and here we are home sweet home how does it I get so confused they all look we're on one of these on these bad boys for the for the weekend so it was just saying that the reason why yesterday we folks are very close to this side here you can get on through like their little right flank thing but because the the qualifier is happening today and track right here the track is literally here so the boats appear back a little bit just in case you know a car that hit two ramp goes in over that fence is going to land safely in the water not on the not on my lap but these are incredible my private chauffeur yeah which is it which is us this is the boat that we're on holy moly I can't believe this okay I just a

things like that is terrible right in there oh it's bit across so that but how did I went sorry fascinating and torture museum in Prague ones well I've never forgotten her on some of the horrible things I saw in there when you work out up to when the last century loads of public hangings and amount of people came out to watch yeah yeah yeah it's a big it was a big day out James ourselves the yellow picnic Hill tea cakes still flask of tea let's go what hanging can't see my feet anymore must under this belly is so huge oh my god Britain had a famous hangman up until the 1950s 60s hanging people really even during the Nuremberg trials sometimes it took a dying Wow Albert Pierrepoint is famous it was the hangman hmm perfecto connects everyone on chopping salary well you can't leave unless Hillary call our time salary you ready sister I like a radish partial to a radish yeah my mom is the love them do you like a radish fans fun car to get one nice one my play only sensor so win call yourself a writer yes hey you know what any kind of radish clubs are you yeah they are quite plain on me like there's no such thing as like radish flavor is it man not a read later hey who do you think you are this is my tree I love chocolate toad Lafitte the cult chunky many hey see ya thank you that when you're in a walled garden yes he's letting on the phone while she's crossing the road let's legalize that what's it I'm making let's go I have just been trying to feel with being like heavily pregnant in this heat and I found out that I am anemic on Fridays so that explains why I'm so tired so I've just started a course of iron tablets today I think I've taken got a lot to take the last form actually but yet obviously when you're all anemic in your iron levels allow it makes you quite tired which explains why I've been so tired recently so in a way I'm kind of glad but I have reason for it and it's not just me like I felt like all I ever said was I'm so tired I'm so tired but now I actually have a reason why I've been so tired so I'm kind of glad that that's happened but yet anyway I just wanted to say sorry haven't been around much today I have been being pregnant and flustered but anyway I will turn it where I'm going with this your foot tonight is called my dad used to be so cool you never guess what before he came along I was a cool guy don't be like that it was not the cool guy this is my dad he seems pretty normal to me you wouldn't believe it but I'm sure he used to be in a rock band he's been death metal bands you know back in the day you're called seventh morning it was like a doom death metal band I don't know if I've ever talked about in the videos before or not but I'm going to talk a little bit about what it's like to transition from being not a dad into a dad so what made him stop something must have happened for him to give it all up maybe he's still a tiny bit cool you think I'm still tell you bit funny because I remember when Hannah folks first show me those like two blue lines on the stick the first thing that hit me really was the fear and it was the fear of knowing that my life would never be the same I would never be the same again like it would fundamentally change me because it does 33 years it took me to get comfortable with the person I was and I was happy being that selfcentered caterpillar munching his way through the lease of life I just didn't know who was going to come out the other end I remember thinking I wasn't ready to be responsible or selfless some like garlic but poor Grayson it kind of felt like I was sitting in this throne in the center of my universe and then once Grayson came along I'm on like a foldout chair lightyears away because what matters now fundamentally is this little bubble of kind of a graceful like that's what my whole purpose is about protecting that bubble I suppose a lot of people when you become a dad you can either be the sort of guy who goes into it and embraces it or the sort of guy who goes in kicking and screaming and I think I went in a bit clicking and screaming but it's always the fear that the worst part once you've done once you've done it you would never want to go back to the old person that you were because that person just cared about himself if I listen really carefully I can still kind of hear that little egotistical selfcentered guy like in me shouting like what about me but yeah he's very distant now and it's so nice being this kind of new person with this new moral compass in this new way of seeing the world I guess this week we really have to lesson with these guys over resin threat as you can see they have the all green traffic light gray so yeah so that's what we're going to have prop up this morning and Gracie and I are going to do some decorating everybody we've got our blueberries and raspberries and strawberries which Grayson has taken a bit of why photos yeah we're going to take it outside we're going in here this is the limited edition box of Ready Brek which is in partnership with we're going on a bear hunt book which happens to be one of our favorites got a packet we have loads of fun ideas of things to do so go out to the park or in your garden you can do that with the garden displays having to do splat emotes moving and cuddling tall yeah are you going to privacy not a home safety and don't really that okay building a K we can make sense mad or mummy wants to make a tenant so computer should get started out so this is going to be ready in 90 seconds gravely and then we can decorate it decorating time although Grayson is already eating all the topics okay ready I'm going to make a face in fear this is a guy he's got a big nose okay honey there we go tada tada right then we are gonna have a little splash around it here Oh Lana see housing often dad yes they've really a great week secondgrade exit the m for example I know that father and we were in a horrible dreadful horrible they're not going to keep me why is that because I can see going great we thought that we would be prophet or they take the open tour bus around Bowl never done it before and I think it's like a

please PLEASE so crew time again this somewhere maybe wax they were like it does work shame on your toys be proud of them you so we're going to a little pub in Barnes Hamptons and I felt like in there a different one years before I've only ever done at one it was really nice I think I was about then you have to smell of a river hey it's got that kind of particulate River style that every River snow arrived in it will resurrect a lover haha the music's that can lead to gone little river ride you said to me one day wearing his dad's house inside a genome a desert like a kayak under the house and he lived by the river and I think what you've never told me this and then we dug it out and we took it on this river ride and then we got addicted and then all we wanted to do any free time that we had we just took this little higher calorie those fishes sat there but then we just were humble down the river and it's just like it was a most cathartic thing I think of everything I've ever done sometimes that you taking me out where I sit fat in the back and not done any like it isn't it's a little canoeing but it is really relaxing and seeing everything from that level you know you're in being Satan isn't it or likely she makes it different being able to smell success that's the wrong step chicken and I can't get to you persisted do you want for the monitor program thing I don't like about Bart is that we're really far away from afraid I've been quite friends yeah i'ma get to the agents how can anyone join it I think it just give you time for anything to be there for each other we haven't become to be very very fun to be like you know what you selected I want to go out with boys boys yeah I I feel a bit lonely yeah what are you doing Wow grated a little bit chattery we've tried to practice people into something with a horrible being pregnant someone or someone gets rekt wrestling but you're so uncomfortable bet you are like all you want to do this is a good thing you plan on your face that liquid all going on bubbling away so I did quite hot liquid itemized quite war I don't think liquid inside human bodies tend to be probable quick you I would love one anything you say what if you clean my feet okay we've been walking around so long how many rubber to Priya massage up so for tinnitus all good okay seaside day oh yeah if the time it takes for the earth to orbit the Sun it's also the amount of time it took boost be brought to send me my new electric staples I have waited for this moment for a very long time came all the way from San Francisco through Cincinnati standard Germany then into England to Heathrow then to a sorting Center in Swindon and finally me back oh yeah safety in compliance there's a control this year whenever you write a booster Ford you risk death or serious injury from the loss of control collision in Falls one you have to put a sticker on there boosted board season or don't the death warning with a product that doesn't make it a little bit more exciting that ends out on his boosted board which he's been excited about for like over a year and he is literally like a kid at Christmas right now I think I've seen in that excited emotional time I've got a few emails that I need to send about Mike London because we have a couple of really exciting things top of the looming about happen anyway so I have a pretty major class which I've probably featured I think on my Instagram somewhere this is the first one I'm using at the moment actually this is the original prototype that's changed slightly from this one but yeah change the fabric and the zip what I've always gone fit now and a little gob emmalin's phones which I really love and then I've got like um a sort of pinky me deep leather one in a different shape because I find that I don't always want to carry like a massive I cut five ring with me so I thought this might be a good option right people that don't necessarily want something massive or you could even need it for like a passport or I don't know whatever you want to use it for so I'm just selling some emails about those two like just finalizing a few decisions and things Stefano has this obsession with neon lighting so it's all it'd be really cool to kind of get one of our quotes that I use for makeup bags and like just the website and stuff and get like an LED neon light type piece of psychup you can hang on the wall so I chose the quite let go because it's my favorite one it's like a yoga mantra also it just means a lot to me that quote because partly because I have had to let go of quite a lot in my life I don't know just it just makes me feel a certain way so I love having it on our wall in our lounge and every time I see it I'm like oh I dunno I'd rather not now but anyway we've decided to you do a few of those but only going to do like I think I think we're only going to sell like 5 to begin with just to see if anyone even likes them because we have no idea we like them but today if you could feel like them and then I think we'll probably do preorder and like made to order because my handwriting as well which is really cool like if you bought one of them like original makeup bags that with one of the quotes that I used on the label so you could probably tell when we caught that door always open to it we did it freaks me out so much you can probably tell that that is my handwriting yeah anyway I've messed up for a really long time about how I'm just going to do some work emails so I'll be doing step which is probably a bit more exciting than me in my office right now first that I was good I'd be lying right now exporting it back I hope that Birkenstocks let's not mess around here where are we let's go I won't go let's go sex club I did take

"yes_WHAT WE EAT IN A DAY  VLOG AD.txt"	"good morning everyone so it's Friday today and I thought I would do and what are eat or actually I guess what we eat in a day video I'm a little obsessive watching me on youtube I love when people might buy in the day video and if you're not heard Justin perform then pretty much as simple as that I'm going to show you everything that we eat today we were also recently contacted by how they fresh which are food subscription service and they do different packages but we were sent the family rocks and that has four different dinner dinners in it or like it's a massive box and show you intersect all of the may embed in everything that you need for four different dinners and I'm really excited about that so it's tied in quite nice in this video so we're going to cook one of the dinners tonight so this is the box that it comes in I've already opened it and put some of the fresh stuff and everything away and and it's absolutely massive and you get so much in here so basically just open it up everything's inside you get a fresh thyme and you get your recipe card which I will show you in a sec and as well as everything else you get this which is like a cool bag and it has all of the meat and the dairy products and anything that needs to stay cold or chilled and so that all comes in about like that resides packs and everything so that even if you can't get it in straight line like get it into your house or you're not there and it arrives and it doesn't have to be unpacked immediately so I think that's really really good as well these are the recipe cards that we have for this week and I think it's quite exciting Israel to not know what meals you're going to be having and what's going to turn up and to maybe even potentially just try something new and just you know not always be stuck in the same routine of the same nails and things so this is what we have and our options available for this week so we have pan fried turkey steak and I love the fact that they have like little picture is of all of the ingredients that you're going to need downside and that one have sausage and butter beans shoo we do like to stew in this house I must say that looks good this is a beef stirfry we love a stirfry well and then obviously the whole recipe and ingredient list again is on the back and this is a bed for a GU rigatoni which is something that we don't usually have so that looks quite interesting but nevertheless we like all of these things so that's good hello fresh has been really kind and given my subscribers pounds of

find some no we're going to get a new one and it's huge so I'll just show you it it doesn't massive in here I have to say but we're getting used to it and then actually has like that much stuff especially in the freezer we need to get a few more like freeze a bit but the whole side of this is frozen and the whole side of this is the fridge and then I've got all the hello fresh dinners in here so what new fridge exciting so our kid requested stereo this morning and that I'll do some freaky cereal and I think the key city want some yogurt and fruit and maybe a slice of toast or
