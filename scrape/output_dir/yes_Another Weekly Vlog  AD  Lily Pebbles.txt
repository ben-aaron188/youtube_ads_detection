started vlogging but I literally did

256
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,480
just wake up and I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> my makeup</font>

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,970
because I'm just filming a few cutaways

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,640
for the video is going up in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

259
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,770
weeks because as I said I'm trying to

260
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">get ahead for LA so that means working a</font>

261
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,540
bit on weekends which is fine because

262
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">rich is gone out for a workout oh gosh</font>

263
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,390
windy and so I'm just quickly gonna film

264
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,850
like five cutaways it's quite hot when

265
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,399
you do make makeup cutaways and it

266
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,630
sounds ridiculous but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite hard</font>

267
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,440
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to like I don't I never</font>

268
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,970
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> my makeup take off and do it again on</font>

269
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same day</font>

270
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,890
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really bad for my skin so</font>

271
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to kind of make time enough</font>

272
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,940
days to do your makeup<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll try to show</font>

273
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,500
like three different foundations and

274
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like three days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of filming can't</font>

275
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,310
really explain but it takes up a lot of

276
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,380
time doing like the cutaways and showing

277
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,960
how the makeup actually looks on my face

278
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,420
so I'm just doing those now my camera

279
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">set up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in front of my little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stool that my bed have made a very neat</font>

281
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,720
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that you guys really care</font>

282
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,070
what's in the background is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wars</font>

285
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't show you what put us in museum</font>

286
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,880
because that we're in the video I think

287
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,350
I'm going to film cutaways the products

288
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,940

293
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,360
quite hard to do it for myself because

294
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,310
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep changing the tripod and it</font>

295
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,170
takes forever and also you're standing

296
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,370
that far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the camera I can</font>
