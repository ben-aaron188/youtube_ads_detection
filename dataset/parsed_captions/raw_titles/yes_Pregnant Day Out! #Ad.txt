good morning my little sugar puff pastry
creams with sprinkles and a cherry on
top oh what a sweet start get it sweet
today I'm having a lovely day out with
Darcy we're going to London just to have
some mummy and Darcy time this is summer
holidays and I want to make the most of
it and I thought I would just film that
adventure a for you and B because I want
to remember these lovely moments we're
getting the London Midland train down we
always get the train down to London
because it's just the easiest thing to
do for us but London Midland have some
cool things going on at the moment which
I thought I would tell you about at the
very start of this video so they don't
forget throughout the day or get you
know discombobulated with all the other
things going on so number one we're
going on London Midland as I've said
it's really handy for us because it's
direct we don't have to faff around with
like driving or traffic jams or worrying
about congestion charges if you're going
into London and parking when you get
then all that business - I have an offer
on for my viewers at the moment so it's
a big discount on tickets it is for a
limited time only in there are T's and
C's so that is linked below if you would
like to come and see that and three
London Midland currently have a thing
called motion which is like you can
watch films and team like shows and
entertainment and they've got some
pretty good titles on there especially
for kids they've got secret life of pets
and minions and I think they've got
Thomas & Friends which made me log his
train watching about train why on a
train so I think that's gonna really
really enjoy that that will make my life
a lot easier and just makes traveling
with kids a lot more fun a lot easier so
I'm gonna go see how Doss is getting on
with putting her socks on which if
you've got a six-year-old you will know
that putting socks and shoes on is quite
the task and head off and have a lovely
lovely day
I never let me get a little set
that's what I was talking about home
this is a motion thing where you can
download films and shows and
entertainment and whatnot so we'll give
it a little go so this isn't the system
but my iPad and basically you can just
pick anything you want so I'm going to
go for like this child-friendly want all
the kids TV and there's always options
doodles what you want to watch Ben and
Holly Peppa Pig and Ed Edd and Eddy

much fun all the same as under Sam I
like Steven universe okay so I think
earlier I said that you have to download
stuff from the
Milton Keynes central good reading

download you just not super genius and

add-in notice they're filling up the
fountain they've got big hose in it
they're filling it all up can you see
the sun's come out which is lovely in
the storybook but Katie goes London the
Lions turned golden and she rides on
them and they transport her all around
London and we are prepared for them not
to turn golden hope but here they are

you thought they would be
massive on their jaunt to see if he can
get up there I'll try
I know this isn't a good picture if that
are taken against the light but Darcy is
in there we got her up
