I keep getting distracted manufacture
with the sexy foil this is the unset
life that's like that's Amy she's our
favorite that's the crew and they said
that's the competition no she's not and
that's - I know that's Amy I'm gone oh
that's a big hammer
yeah zoom it
very healthy so the hidden all the
mirrors I think it's because of the
transformer they don't want anyone else
to see themselves it's a very sort of
make no look back
if from some more rooms like way back
there
we have to save battery
yeah I would ignore myself instead you
have to watch it here in the UK

especially Joe for nothing
and I include six so hot like in an
attic of like a four-story five-story
building I wanna heat is just rising and
I'm going to this big card a good cut
but it's for we having fun I think I did
enjoy yourself as well
and describe others style for me I just
thought it's really nice and she sort of
weird like a lot of my stuff's blouses
and jeans always in minerals so how tell
me about the beard how long we can grow
in there
oh so the build is probably been with me
for about four years is sort of I've
chopped and trimmed it and you might
look a bit crazy sometimes I do try to
keep on top of it but it just like to
grow well yeah like say it's been with
me for about four years and when's the
last time you actually like fully shaved
I was 13 years old when I fully change
it and what I like is all the reaction
to your being positive have you had any
I probably had more negative feedback
about my beard and positive but again if
I mom on you or you hate it and yeah a
lot more people read it to me why you
don't know obviously I could understand
you looking at me you know me out there
and it's it can get cleaned up so that's
fine but hinted a little just about
people get all right what do you think
of your I love it I think my being will
be repeat for the foreseeable future I
can you not feel it will be with me for
a long time

a new submission is their daughter their
children just just going on so I'm about
to go on now okay so start with them

Nottingham and I'm 28 years old

Ida I'm 28 and I'm from Nottingham
can you describe your style my spout is
diverse I would describe it as straight
away because I like to wear according to
where I'm going so up top and jeans it's
my go-to probably high-waisted jeans and
a cool top or a nice dress nice fitted
dress to show off my shape that's my
perfect describe Joe's looks me Josh
look I think Joe looks like he's trying
to hide his shape and he tried to hide
how he looks and I would like him a good
map like if they for him to show himself
more and so he's more of a I want to
wear jeans are too tight I want to atop
sock to tile and then I want to cover it
all up with a big massive jacket so
that's more his style or you have like
long line t-shirts or long line
everything hit because his thoughts are
water so he's something telling me about
some people don't like his beard yeah
well how does he feel or how do you feel
about people not like this big
it really doesn't bother me that people
doesn't it really doesn't bother me that
people don't likely to be it because I
love it see it and we both know that
he's being is a bit of a Marmite and
either you love it or you really hate it
and think he looks homeless or like a
caveman and some people have that but we
love the beard because it makes him look
like a Viking it's my Viking hi guys so
