very good here I think it's a fresh
grout is this a hotel or is this an
apartment apartment goals we've got
living room got a living room oh good

just hear the echo hear the echo echo
echo one we're getting some food please
hit the bed okay
Nikki the size of my foot bed and you
guys know my sister
in as well so that's a really big word
that anytime having something big it
gets compared to the size of my head
your head is quite gigantic I have now
the international barometer for big
things so we are staying at the Ritz
Carlton and this is their restaurant
name for the cafe and we must have
brunch but we are late we missed lunch
but they still got the menu something
else something in society

life and if there's food I'm a happy
bunny oh my god

sunny and we're loving it and last night

eventful taxi journey judge arrived

here is I think called Burj Khalifa and
this is that I think it's the tallest
building in the world is it it is look

this is the unromantic thing is it feel
romantic to you right now so romantic
that just came it's what we're having
it's back these are kind of active like
prawn crackers but nicer and this is a
peanut kind of children a peanut soup
the head chef here at guitar he's come
up and say hi to us so appreciated and
the food is lovely my she was actually
lovely I know I like this female head
shape very happy so the number one Thai
restaurant can you say I got the ISIS

but it's delicious oh my god right now
okay stop I have a white pizza big
enough to fill my latest one but we're
now back I'm about to run myself an
indulgent bath because I never ever ever
have a bar don't appreciate things like
this until you haven't done them in a
while and then you really do enjoy it so
yeah very happy good morning guys
another day another dollar
what's my I could do he's hiding I think
he's naked good morning
we're going to the roof and there's a
pool up there now if you guys know me
you know that water is not really my
thing
and water is Michael's thing that's I've
got my full face of hair and makeup on
because I'm gonna lounge there but I'm
not going to be dipping a toe into that
water
you know water's more of a Michael thing
really but yeah nice lovely day it's a
Sunday but sunday is a working day here
so they start their week weekend is
Friday and Saturday so that's an
interesting fact stuff on the roof now
enjoying the views having a little mini
photo shoot but thankfully in the
morning is really quite up here so like
no but not too many people give us weird
looks like floundering around and taking
pictures by the pillars were really
embarrassed by taking
I really liked it even Disney
around it's hard work but you can't
really like hair out and block out and
say to all the rest of the guests in the
hotel
get off the rooftop we're taking a photo
sheet but we just have to work with it
you know
by the way it's nice up here The Morning
Sun is not to baking yet you have little
swings women to jump in there I have a
little bit I'm trying to convince you to
come in the pool with me I'm coming in I
got to come in only just dip my toe and
don't mess up my hair and my maker
I'm not going in
we're having a fun night he tried to
suck special on me he got the balls it's
not entirely true it was more of an
elbow to the balls just trying to debate
right now whether or not it would be a
funny idea to under the water
you understand that layer is an act so
if you do something like that
you're going to you're going to be a
dead man walk you can assure as your
swimming technique mode fun fact a lot
of you guys have realized this whole
dongs games it scorched Patricia was
actually in the Olympic Trials for the
British swim team recently you know
although the problem was when she nearly
sunk they had to call the lab guys to
fish it up back up she didn't get very
far
guys check it out I've handed like an
hour can you see the lines
I went look at my arms that's where your
top was there right yeah and you guys
should see the rest of it but you don't
need to think that but look at that
that's where the arms were that is where
the all over I'm shocked that I tan that
quickly and that obviously wasn't that
hot was it
it's not about heat there darlinks about
sun exposure see black people do tan
change my look again we are about to go
out for lunch and then we're going on an
Arabian adventure so I decided to take
off the throw ponytail because I don't
want to be embarrassed on the back of a
camel and then the ponytail just ends up
on the floor so we are rocking with this
look right better now which makes me
look about 6 but it's ok we'll make that
work also I know lots of you guys are
gonna ask me about what brand of like
swimsuits I'm wearing it's from a brand
called a shanty swimwear I think the
lady who does it is a friend of my
cousin and gave it to my cousin and then
my cousin and gave it to me and I was
like these are really good they really
amazed oh yes yes oh sorry darlin model
