front seat because I get really travel
sick if we sit in the back and some of
you guys know this but i'm not sure all
of you do we're actually from dropping
in so
in London I know the most bizarre in
London so it takes us about three hours
to get to the event so I've got my
little office on the go on my lap here I
had looked for so long for a marble
laptop keys I literally wanted this for
a year and i finally found more from
coconut lane I saw so many Instagram
pictures with these so I find him out to
get one and then if you guys ever want
to know what camera i use for the
lighting isn't great here this is my
camera be using per se it's actually a
cannon it's so well loved the thing is
come on it's a 600d thereby does my hair
put it on my lap just like I didn't know
what it was like buddhist or a
caterpillar race now under your feet but
what was it doing its Caroline of that
only you can fucking a like that
snapchat you think that you can do with
butterflies yeah yeah just put my so
Holly can do a snapchat with calling the
customer the hotline hi welcome to the
Sheridan
you
made it to max factor's balama the
studio I want to get kale smoothie my
face is very very shiny I know sorry
about that Caroline Barnes is here Max
Factor's makeup artist and I need to
touch up with make her focus I literally
like a shiny met after that journey and
I'm going to show you outside as well oh
I've actually come across Caroline
you'll see Caroline did a little bit
doing my makeup how lucky we outside the
sun shining with the sickness I love how
you're out here in the sun does my idea
as well wlky's fucking outside look a
little guys how amazing is it so
beautiful I'm going to try not to
fangirl Caroline too much she's
literally my makeup hero so I'm going to
get her to do some foundation maybe a
bit of eyeliner you know I hate putting
eyeliner on but it's just so nice of a
real lucky to be here with my family
I've had the healthy smoothie and now
I've just found the naughty macarons
annoyingly though I think they're part
of the display will anyone notice if I
take one of the tasty morons makeup
goodies go
yah
this is the finished look guys the
freckles are free I swear something it
was really natural you know me I'm not
really into my massive but smoke tires
or colors i'm going to show you guys
really quickly a kind of mini get ready
with me with what we used because it's
probably taking too long to show you as
we were doing it i already have this on
earlier it's the Max Factor smoothie
that miracle primer so I didn't need to
put any more of that on this feels so
soft you guys know I bang on about
putting primers ohms it just holds
everything in place but this one feels
really nice and soft on your skin and
just perhaps everything and then we've
used the miracle touch foundation I've
already had this for a few years so I
knew I was going to like this but it has
a brand new swanky beautiful packaging
it is actually really beautiful I like
gold and that's actually very pretty I'm
obsessed with compacts as well with
cushions in and this is really good just
to get that nice really like flawless
finish and plus it's easy just to carry
around and top up as you go through the
day the consistency of this guy's if you
have tried it before is beautiful it
goes on really really soft and satiny
and just turns actually quite matte on
your skin because I get really greasy so
it's good to get rid of any shine and
then we've used this really pretty blush
it by Max Factor and I'm laughing
because I'm already on my third part of
this this is the max back to excess
shimmer you might recognize it from some
of my videos and my favorite ones in
copper so we put that on today yes I'm
wearing a lipstick I can't believe
someone has actually managed to get
lipstick on me and it actually looks
really nice because this is really
natural it looks really pink here but I
think it looks really nice when it goes
on your lips and then with you some
masterpiece glamour extensions mascara I
love the black brown one of this but the
black one today let's really nice and
then we've used a lip liner and then a
little bit of eyeliner you know what I'm
like this is the excess intensity and
actually I think that it's really pretty
mainly because it's brown so if you
don't like smoky eyes like me stick with
a brown
I need to have seen you in ages ages you
look so great happy wake up look at his
hair we're just say I spent my whole
life when I get curls in my head it's a
frizzy very busy period be cancelled are
you learn me toca m√∫sica TV oh these
green trees do you like it home sweet
home I am so close it for today it was
so good there is only one thing to do
it's pampa time oh they're monochrome
heavy engrave the words we don't say and
at any moment I know we're gonna see the
rain yeah yeah and you say oh I'm so
gelo why can't I be brave cuz you let go
and I let go nobody take the blame the
one thing keeping my whole life it's the
same thing to tell me we won't survive
