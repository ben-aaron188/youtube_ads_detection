we went to HomeSense as you know and it
was absolutely brilliant very successful
got some amazing bits so I'm hoping I
saw these in the sale I tried them on
and they looked so cute so I got myself
a pair of dungarees but it's a dungarees
dress so it was in my size it was
originally 20 pounds in the cell 210 and
then it's scanned up at 7 pounds fits me
so nicely and I just sit with a disney
top and some trainers this is gonna be a
really cute little outfit for Florida so
