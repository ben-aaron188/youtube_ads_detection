now Trang which is an absolutely
beautiful place is stunning we're
basically at a resort I'm still here at
Virgin holidays I said they put on an
amazing incredible trip and we're at the
Six Senses resort now we're basically
private island and it's its own hotel
resort and it's a jungle it is just
incredible so I thought today I couldn't
oh my god is madness so yeah first thing
you got private infinity pool right
there private pool how insane is that
and there's literally no one around like
and you can see why it's called The Rock
Villa con you because it's very rocky
and you walk down here boom that balcony
goes all the way along madness isn't it
I quite honestly don't think I've ever
witnessed a greater room than this
