this new jump I got this from and other
stories last week and I love it so much
because it's such a nice really
lightweight jumper I love the stripe
like the thickness it's amazing quality
I could go on and on about it and but I
love it like I've had tucked in some of
the day left it out some of the day I
love that I have a white-hot like color
as well it's just so nice and comfy and
and then these shoes got so much
attention on my Instagram they're from
and other stories as well but on the
same day and they're so comfy so nice I
love the color I highly recommend them
we're back to the hotel that we were
staying out the Med which is amazing you
