yeah we saw Finding Neverland last night
on Broadway and it was so good it was
such a beautiful story and it's like the
choreography was just ridiculous in the
talent of the cars like they were so
good weren't they yeah they were amazing
and it was just such a magical show and
in this star hotel by the way it was the
art hotel and it was lovely that we're
off the bed so something I'm so sad to
me i absolutely just loved it here I
