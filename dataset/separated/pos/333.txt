actually I'm doing a collaboration with
Bang & Olufsen and they've just sent out
the most insane speaker so I thought you
guys would appreciate it
if any of you guys are familiar with
banging also and you'll know that sound
systems are like top-quality this stuff
is just like another level and they sent
me some headphones called the h8 and
then saying the low your over the ear
headphones but the quality is just so
good and they sent out their new speaker
which is the Bo sound 35 is let's take a
look at that quickly
