and sheet today and I'm going to be
trying this foundation that I got
yesterday I'm really excited to try it
because I've heard so much about it I'm
hoping that the colors right because I
did get and color matched I got in shade
today so I just shot this outfit this
outfit number two from the blog post and
I'm obsessed of it I absolutely love it
you know when you've got something on
you thought I never thought of putting
that together and I actually really like
it I'm wearing a shirt and jumper combo
from look again my Barberie Mac my
burberry scarf citizens of humanity
jeans of course and my st. neuron boots
although I'm really loving this
Charlotte Tilbury foundation it's quite
but it stays in place so well it's
really really nice actually I wasn't
