I don't even mention the 3d camera like
how far there you go I can see the sea
and everything looks so beautiful
that is so gorgeous driving around here
so so lovely I love this now for a
coffee break
they're really really cute little cafe
apparently it's one of the oldest
watching this vlog Lisbon is so
beautiful
every corner you turn there's just
something to take a photo of it's just
absolutely gorgeous and I definitely
want to go back for a longer time
