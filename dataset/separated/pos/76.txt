to the valo Dance Academy for my lesson
and I'm so excited here we go and here
I've got this necklace on which is from
kishi jewelry and I never take this off
my queen necklace I love it so much and
really bad to get now I'm having a
little bit of a long fair with it again
because it just literally feels like
you're not wearing anything the coverage
is really really good so that was the
new bare minerals one and then I've used
not as a baby roll mascara from L'Oreal
which everybody loves and I took so long
to try it but it is ridiculous and it's
amazing and then the new Armani eyebrow
products which I really really love and
so three like new bits that I've tried
