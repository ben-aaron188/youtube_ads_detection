they're the comfiest shoes ever and yeah
they're quite outrageous you ready to
see them here they are everybody they
are called night Presto's I believe
they're new and they're like digi sand
so they're like 16-bit but like camo
kind of thing they're like sandy I don't
know if they are like the comfy shoes I
have ever worn so when I tried them on I
was I don't even care if they look
ridiculous or not these feel like my
feet are being cuddled so I have to buy
them anyways
