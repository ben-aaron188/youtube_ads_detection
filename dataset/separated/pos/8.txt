so I just wanted the cathedral and
you'll see right here beautiful I didn't
so much in there just out of respect
like a couple shots they will show you
in the National Library and he was like
the most beautiful place I've ever been
so I just did the upper belvedere
it was beautiful I couldn't really feel
much I found a couple of the halls which
I'll show you obviously and they were
gorgeous or the marble staircase like
blew my mind and they have the food
that was the best five euros I think of
a button oh my god amazing such a
beautiful way to see the city at the
shine like the most perfect autumn day
oh my god i was in fact that experience
