see undressing stuff so I got this from
Wolf Pack supply I believe they've
changed their name now I'm just really
cool colored like a Rasta leash and it's
got like a nice clip on it so I think
I'll be better for the harness than the
one we had before I'm super excited
so thanks well my pencils of war packs I
actually bought these but I'll leave a
link down below because it interested so
nice I really like this leash it's cute
it's very short though and I thought
it'd be thicker but I kind of love it
