a few weeks ago Dorset cereals sent us
an email asking if we'd like to hang out
with them a festival in Oxfordshire
Dorset series believed life should be
about taking pleasure in the simple
things in taking it slow and not just a
great breakfast then while we like the
car and went to hang out with our major
dorcet cereals and we're so glad we did
anyway on with the show
