I've loved wearing this dress today this
is from Tiffany Rose it felt very dolce
gabbana and I'm gonna do a maternity
sort of evening wear look book so make
sure this goes in because it's a really
good one if anybody's pregnant and
thinking they need a dress for Christmas
or something it just looks really sort
of smart and I don't know I really like
it
it hugs in all the right places so
