two outfits for a blog post I'm working
on with a source which is really
exciting and love a source those was
really nice when you get to work with a
brand that you literally talk about like
in every single bloody video we shot
got home and these are waiting for me
from Viktor and Rolf these are so
gorgeous but this bouquet is like three
times the size of my head but it's
insane I'm doing a little bit of lag
a chop shop order arrived which I'm
really excited to show you
I thought no where so that they are now
doing Liberty print items and they're
like limited-edition and stuff like that
so I picked up a few pieces I just like
try them on see what the fit is like if
I like any of it if not send it back
middle I think by the way this is from
H&M home super cute I love it I have
top and then this pink skirt which I
really like I'm hoping this looks good
on because I really think it's cute and
and then I brought this skirt as well I
really like the print of it so I didn't
like the top version of it by ordered
this just because I think I will really
like this and get a lot of wear out of
it but and yeah I'm not going to keep
all on and see it all looks really
interesting so these are the cute little
these are actually shorts I can remember
for shorts or a skirt it shorts and I
really like the print of these so cute
they're a really nice fit they're just
like perfect just absolute perfect oh my
gosh I really like the pink skirt is so
cute tennis it's a bit too much like
other ruffles too much I like the cut of
it at the bottom I think it's really
flattering I think it's one of those
things that might only work in the
summer so I don't know I need to think
about how much wear out that I will get
over the next few summers but so pretty
shorts of these I really like the
print I think it's really nice I'm not
