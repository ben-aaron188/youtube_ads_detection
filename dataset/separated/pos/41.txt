Foxx in it and he's and Dreamgirls

absolutely know that when Jamie Fox

song I saying she and girl dude an
actress that plays Annie in the film is
so cute she is incredible her singing
to us boss by playlist so you can listen
to them as well and dance around the
room like the gym we would love to see
you guys sing a hard-knock life and if
you do you can actually win a recording
studio session and shopping spree and
we're actually going shopping today so I
would kind of love a shopping spree

do this by like a Twitter video or a
