is nice so I've got the kind of skin
replenishing rich moisturizer which I've
actually bought and had before I really
like this and also had their facial wash
actually don't think I've used this my
skin is in need of them a new facial
wash and everything is so sensitive on
my skin by can you simple which is great
so yeah it got to me bits from them I'm
stay how to make I see how exciting
with what Apple spritz naturally
caffeine free and you have peach
lemonade oh my gosh nice and so yummy
very thank you very much
arrives today so first of all I got new
pair of Havana's the needs of my
favorite flip-flops in the whole world
I call them Havana's but they are
actually heavy honors I think that's
actually how you say it have the Yanis I
know I've always called them Havana's
but anyway so I love these I got them
for my 25th birthday so it happened two
years and they served me so well I love
them a lot and they're pretty much all I
live in and I kind of wanted a second
pair and I went on a self and I was just
browsing that's all they had Disney one
so I already had to get these and I'll
link them below if you're interested
because I haven't seen anyone talking
about them yet or anything and I just
think they're gorgeous
ordered this dress from boohoo it's so
cute what when Isis but it's from boohoo
I really like the detailing on it I
think it's so pretty for holiday it's
quite a thin material but it sucks me in
at the waist here which is my favorite
part and it's even got a little pockets
which is great of an evening and just
tucking my phone in my pocket but yeah I
really like it really suits me and I
think this is in the sales like 14
pounds or something I will link that
below if you're interested but I think
trying to say is the girl at benefit in
Bournemouth infinity Hamer's she's super
nice and she does such a good job
because I've been going to that same
brow bar for years now and there used to
a sea but this is the micelle a gel wash
the hydrating booster which you can use
the primer mixed in with your foundation
and is amazing actually I tried it
that and then using some of this so this
is meant to be amazing for dehydrated
and dry skin which is definitely me
so these are coming nationwide to stores
in September but I still so in boots
today so they are making their way into
stores now if your interest
yeah I'm really excited to try them not
an ad just enough to brand a lot it's
