because we ordered this mattress in a
box and so we're probably going to be
sleeping on the floor with no like bed
frame for like a long time because it
takes forever the JumpShip best brains
so right now if you have the sun bucks
with a lion on it so we're going to set
it up so that we have somewhere to sleep
and I love these mattresses in a box
they just they're like the perfect like
like firmness you know the not yourself
not too firm and they're so cool they
just like come to your house in a box
we are upgrading to a king size what
this is so efficient I recommend getting
a mattress in a box sweet it's going to
like expand apparently for the next like
2 to 5 hours so we shouldn't go on it
PS I will put a discount code down below
for y'all $50 off but what the TV goes
