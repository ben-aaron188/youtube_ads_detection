look tired I've also got a new lip combo
on which is Mac boldly bare and then
look with Ebola that her stationary it's
Mac boldly better than lip liner and Mac
have just released their new lip
densities and they sent me their entire
range which was very very exciting so I
thought that I would try them out and
I've just found a color by apps that you
love it's called doh
and it's kind of like a brown you need
this is I think this is a little bit
darker than it is so I was scared to use
this initially but it's really beautiful
and it's really nice
