different more of a kind of lifestyle
video and it's sponsored by Invisalign
so some of you might know that recently
I've been wearing they're almost
invisible braces and lots of people ask
questions since I've had them how does
it work how does it beep you what's the
treatment be like I'm almost at the end
of it now and I've been super happy with
it and so what it's make a video to say
thank you to this line and I've done it
like now when you walk in they scan your
teeth with this kind of magical camera
which makes this 3d model so you can
kind of rotate it and see everything and
then you can also see step-by-step how
it's going to change so you can see
right to the finished product like what
its gonna look like at the end which was
really cool and yeah so I kind of knew
