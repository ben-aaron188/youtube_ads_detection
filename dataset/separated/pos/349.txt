going to be working with L'Oreal
professionals so I thought that you guys
could come along with me to that because
it will be quite a nice evening and some
also be quite fun to mention that you
can also enter a competition with Allah
and scared yogurt you can win return
flights for to to Reykjavik in Iceland
where you'll have private transfers for
nights accommodation in a four-star
hotel and breakfast for two adults with
blue lagoons trips for two and a
Reykjavik food walking tour for two
adults and travel insurance as well all
you have to do is upload your own little
recipe to Instagram and use the hashtag
to share my skin so yeah I just thought
that was a nice little competition to
mention that I've never been to Iceland
