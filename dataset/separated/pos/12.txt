because I partnered up with Kinder Bueno
on this video to do their try a bit of
different challenge and I'm basically
going to do exactly that so I'm going to
do something later data is completely
out of my comfort zone like how I'm
the thumb they're one of the best days
about work on kinder Wayne is that you
have to try the product a little bit to
check this out a lovely box full where
no got some white chocolate ones in
there got some milk chocolate ones in
there this box is obviously a bit more
full but what can I say I'm a bit of a
fan then why can I have very different
tastes when it comes to chocolate bars
thank you so much to Kinder Bueno for
partnering with me on this video because
it was honestly amazing and it's fun to
host this today out so I hope you
