could fry but right now I am heading to
ballet bar in Norwich where I live and
there's a large studio and I spoke to
freak last night number II really
excited and I'm hoping they're going to
kick my book cause you know when you
need somebody else to get clip on so I
will let you guys know how it goes
something tells me it's going to be
really difficult welcome to the studio
freaking I loved it with so much fun and
my butt is going to really hurt tomorrow
tomorrow and then I've done overnight
oats and this is of the chocolate
variety Williams got in I've got it it's
literally this rebel milk chocolate and
it's dairy-free and it's it just super
yummy we just want to think of it not
