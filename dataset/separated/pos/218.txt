Lauder Double Wear nude foundations in
the wrong shade and they said I can go
into the store Carnaby Street and much
to the right shade and take one there
he's like a really nice like lightweight
foundation so I definitely want to find
my correct shade you've always only like
Spanish that Farsi warm so he may think
I'm really dark
