Alex and Virant I've come to Ibiza and
it's gonna be blue it's going to be
crazy
we've come to Ibiza it's going to be a
lot of fun we've literally just got here
I believe that taps pronounce the SH
wire and I've heard very very very good
things about it when I say some friends
who have been tied me to sport I was
saying here they're pretty jealous so it
should be pretty cool some pretty
colorful spaceship looking bets over
here we've got it all we've got the
party stuff here you know we've got some
more party bits down here you know where
