airport ever fact so this has been a
slightly more relaxing experience that
was super early today so we're now in
the escape route I my swiveling in this
huge triple check so comfy so we're
going to conclude I get really nervous
about flying so I wanted just to come to
the lounge just relax and the form of
light and I believe its leave babies I
just had the most amazing facial and I
only got a makeover I didn't even know
they did that in this airport so it's
like a spa oh and then we did so much
shopping through buying Christmas
presents as well and we bought so many
that we can't carry them so luckily in
collecting when you go back so we just
left a pair and then we'll get the
fibers but also gonna buy stuff at the
Christmas market as well so the world
