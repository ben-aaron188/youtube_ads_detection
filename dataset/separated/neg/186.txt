hi everyone welcome back to my channel
sent us to Sweden the ice hotel and I
surprised my sister by taking her along
because she is amazing I love her so
much she's the best and without her I
don't know how I would be able to do a
lot of things that I do so it was
minus 6 on the night that we went there
and in the morning nu greeted with some
lingonberry juice it was very warmed up
so it was kind of like a nice little
wake-up call for us was so so far one of
the reasons why I decided to partner up
with light and free is because it's an
amazing brand and it represents
everything I'm about you know I love
the footage from our trip to Sweden and
without further ado here it is
oh my god guys it a shaving of ice ice
oh cool we are actually gonna be
sleeping here tonight
this is also the coordination of it look
it's like an an ice thing with color
it's so cool look at our bed guys that
is awesome

Ribena so we just had a wake up call
with some hot linger berry juice it's
really really nice look at that it guess
is my clothing that's one night done in
the ice room and surprisingly it was a
very very good night's sleep

the warm room tonight and here are this
